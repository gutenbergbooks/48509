<p class="noind">It is said to have been a chance occasion which
gave the first impetus towards the compilation of
the German original<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> from which these "Reminiscences
of the King of Roumania have been re-edited
and abridged." One day an enterprising
man of letters applied to one who had followed
the King's career for years with vivid interest:
"The public of a country extending from the Alps
to the ocean is eager to know something about
Roumania and her Hohenzollern ruler." The
King, without whose consent little or nothing
could have been done, thought the matter over
carefully; in fact, he weighed it in his mind for
several years before coming to a final decision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
At first his natural antipathy to being talked
about&mdash;even in praise (to criticism he had ever
been indifferent)&mdash;made him reluctant to provide
printed matter for public comment. On the
other hand, he had long been most anxious that
Roumania should attract more public attention
than the world had hitherto bestowed on her.
In an age of universal trade competition and self-advertisement,
for a country to be talked about
possibly meant attracting capitalists and opening
up markets: things which might add materially
to her prosperity. With such possibilities in
view, the King's own personal taste or scruples
were of secondary moment to him. So the idea
first suggested by a stranger gradually took shape
in his mind, and with it the desire to see placed
before his own subjects a truthful record of what
had been achieved in Roumania in his own time.
By these means he hoped to give his people an
instructive synopsis of the difficulties which had
been successfully overcome in the task of creating
practical institutions out of chaos.</p>

<p>As so often happens in such cases, the work
grew beyond the limits originally entertained.
But the task was no easy one, and involved the
labour of several years. However, the result
achieved is well worth the trouble, for it is
an historical document of exceptional political
interest, containing, among other material, important
letters from Prince Bismarck, the Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
William, the Emperor Frederick, the Czar of
Russia, Queen Victoria, and Napoleon III. It
is, in fact, a piece of work which a politician
must consult unless he is to remain in the dark
concerning much of moment in the political history
of our time, and particularly in the history of the
Eastern Question. "The Reminiscences of the
King of Roumania" constitute an important page
in the story of European progress. Nor is this
all. They also contain a study in self-revelation
which, so far as it belongs to a regal character,
is absolutely unique in its completeness&mdash;even in
an age so rich in sensational memoirs as our own.</p>

<p>The subject-matter deals with a period of over
twenty-five years in the life of a young European
nation, in the course of which she gained her
independence and strove successfully to retain it,
whilst more than trebling her resources in peaceful
work. In this eventful period greater changes
have taken place in the balance of power in
Europe than in many preceding centuries. A
republic has replaced a monarchy in France, and
also on the other side of the Atlantic, in Brazil,
since the days when a young captain of a Prussian
guard regiment, a scion of the House of Hohenzollern,
set himself single-handed the Sisyphean
task of establishing a constitutional representative
monarchy on a soil where hitherto
periodical conspiracies and revolts had run riot
luxuriously. Just here, however, our democratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
age has witnessed the realisation of the problem
treated by Macchiavelli in "Il Principe"&mdash;the
self-education of a prince.</p>

<p>To-day, the man who thirty-three years ago
came down the Danube as a perfect stranger&mdash;practically
alone, without tried councillors or
adherents&mdash;is to all intents and purposes the
omnipotent ruler of a country which owes its
independence and present position entirely to his
statesmanship. Nor can there be much doubt that
but for him Roumania and the Lower Danube
might be now little more than a name to the rest
of Europe&mdash;as, indeed, they were in the past.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>King Charles of Roumania is the second son of
the late Prince Charles Anthony<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen:
the elder South German
Roman Catholic branch of the House of Hohenzollern,
of which the German Emperor is the
chief. Until the year 1849 the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringens,
whose dominions are situated
between Württemberg and Baden, near the spot
where the Danube rises in the Black Forest,
possessed full sovereign rights as the head of one
of the independent principalities of the German
Confederation. These sovereign rights of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
own and his descendants Prince Charles Anthony
formally and voluntarily ceded to Prussia on
December 7, 1849. Of him we are credibly
informed:</p>

<p>"Prince Charles Anthony lives in the history
of the German people as a man of liberal thought
and high character, who of his own free will gave
up his sovereign prerogative for the sake of the
cause of German Unity. His memory is green in
the hearts of his children as the ideal of a father,
who&mdash;for all his strictness and discipline&mdash;was
not feared, but ever loved and honoured, by his
family. He was always the best friend and
adviser of his grown-up sons." His letters to his
son Charles, which are frequently quoted in the
present memoir, fully bear out this testimony to
the Prince's intimate, almost ideal, relationship
with his children, as also to the magnanimity
with which he is universally credited.</p>

<p>Of the King's mother&mdash;Princess Josephine of
Baden&mdash;we learn: "Princess Josephine was
deeply religious without being in the least
bigoted. Her unselfishness earned for her the
love and devotion of all those who knew her. As
a wife and a mother her life was one of exceptional
harmony and happiness. The great deference
which King Charles has always shown to the
other sex has its source in the veneration which
he felt for his mother."</p>

<p>Prince Charles was born on April 20, 1839,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
at the ancestral castle of the Hohenzollerns at
Sigmaringen on the Danube, then ruled over by
his grandfather, the reigning Prince Charles of
Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. The castle was not
in those days the treasury of art and history
which it is at the present day. The grandfatherly
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> was of a patriarchal, almost
despotic kind: every detail of household affairs
was regulated with a view to strict economy.
Though, perhaps, unpleasant at times, all this
proved to be invaluable training for the young
Prince, whose ultimate destiny it was to rule over
one of the most extravagant peoples in Europe.
Punctuality was strictly enforced: at nine o'clock
the old Prince wound up his watch as a sign that
the day was over, and at ten darkness and silence
reigned supreme over the household.</p>

<p>Prince Charles was a delicate child, and was
considered so throughout his early manhood,
though in reality his health and bodily powers
left little to be desired. The first happy years of
his childhood were passed at Sigmaringen and the
summer residences of Inzigkofen and Krauchenwies.
This peaceful life was broken by a visit in
1846 to his maternal grandmother, the Grand
Duchess Stéphanie of Baden. On this occasion
Prince Charles attracted the attention and
interest of Mme. Hortense Cornu, the intimate
friend and confidant of Prince Louis Napoleon&mdash;later
Napoleon III.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>It cannot be said that the young Prince progressed
very rapidly in his studies; but though
he learned slowly, his memory proved most
retentive. His naturally independent and strong
character, moreover, prevented him from adopting
outside opinions too readily, and this trait he
retained in after years. For though as King of
Roumania he is ever willing to listen to the
opinion of others, the decision invariably remains
in his own hands.</p>

<p>An exciting period supervened for the little
South German Principality with the year 1848,
when the revolutionary wave forced the old
Prince to abdicate in favour of his son Prince
Charles Anthony. Owing to the action of a
"Committee of Public Safety," the Hohenzollern
family quitted Sigmaringen on September 27.
This the children used to call the "first flight"
in contradistinction to the "second," some seven
months later. Though Prince Charles Anthony
succeeded in gaining the upper hand over the
revolutionary movement of '48, the trouble commenced
again in 1849 owing to the insurrection
in the Grand Duchy of Baden. As soon as order
had been completely restored, Prince Charles
Anthony carried out his long-cherished plan of
transferring the sovereignty of the Hohenzollern
Principality to the King of Prussia, and in a farewell
speech he declared his sole reason to be "the
desire to promote the unity, greatness, and power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
of the German people." The family settled first
at Neisse in Prussian Silesia, then at Düsseldorf,
as Prince Charles Anthony was appointed to the
command of the Fourteenth Military Division,
while Prince Charles Anthony, and later on also
his brother Friedrich, were settled with their
tutor in Dresden, where Prince Charles spent
seven years.</p>

<p>Before joining his parents at Düsseldorf, Prince
Charles successfully passed his ensign's examination,
though he was entitled as a Prince of the
House of Hohenzollern to claim his commission
without submitting to this test. As a reward for
his success he was permitted to make a tour
through Switzerland and Upper Italy before
being placed under his previously appointed military
governor, Captain von Hagens. This officer
was a man in every way fitted to instruct and
prepare the young Prince for his career by developing
his powers of initiative and independence
of action. In accordance with his expressed wish,
he was gazetted Second Lieutenant in the Prussian
Artillery of the Guard, but was not required
to join his corps until his studies were completed.
A thorough knowledge of the practical part of his
profession was acquired at the fortress of Jülich,
followed, after a visit to the celebrated Krupp
Works at Essen, by a course of instruction at
Berlin.</p>

<p>The betrothal of his sister, Princess Stéphanie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
to King Pedro V. of Portugal, in the autumn of
1857, was followed by her marriage by proxy at
Berlin on April 29, 1858, whilst another important
family event occurred in November of the same
year. William, Prince of Prussia (afterwards King
William I., who had assumed the regency during
the illness of his brother the King, Frederick
William IV.), appointed Prince Charles Anthony,
of Hohenzollern, to the Presidency of the Prussian
Ministry. His son Charles developed the greatest
interest in politics, and at that time unconsciously
acquired a fund of diplomatic knowledge and experience
which was to stand him in good stead in
his future career.</p>

<p>In the midst of the gaieties of Berlin the Prince
was deeply affected by the melancholy news of the
death of his sister Stéphanie on July 17, 1859.
Two years later the marriage of his brother
Leopold to the Infanta Antoinette of Portugal
afforded him a welcome opportunity of visiting
the last resting-place of his dearly loved sister
near Lisbon. On his return from his journey,
Prince Charles requested to be transferred to an
Hussar Regiment, as the artillery did not appear
at that time to take that place in public estimation
to which it was entitled. This application,
however, was postponed until his return from a
long tour through the South of France, Algiers,
Gibraltar, Spain, and Paris. After a short stay
at the University of Bonn, Prince Charles again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
resumed military duty as First Lieutenant in the
Second Dragoon Guards stationed at Berlin, where
he speedily regained the position he had formerly
held in the society of the capital. The Royal
Family, especially the Crown Prince, welcomed
their South German relative most warmly, and
the friendship thus created was subsequently
more than equal to the test of time and
separation.</p>

<p>A second visit to the Imperial Court of France in
1863, this time at the invitation of Napoleon III.,
was intended by the latter to culminate in a
betrothal to a Princess of his House, but the project
fell through, as the proposed conditions did
not find favour with the King of Prussia. Prince
Charles was forced to content himself with the
consolation offered by King William, that he
would soon forget the fair lady amidst the scenes
of war (in Denmark). As orderly officer to his
friend the Crown Prince of Prussia, Prince
Charles took part in the siege and assault of the
Düppel entrenchments, the capture of Fridericia,
and the invasion of Jütland. The experience he
gained of war and camp-life during this period
was of inestimable benefit to the young soldier,
who was afterwards called upon to achieve the
independence of Roumania on the battlefields of
Bulgaria.</p>

<p>The war of 1864 having come to an end, Prince
Charles returned to the somewhat dreary monotony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
of garrison life in Berlin. This not unnaturally
soon gave rise to a feeling of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> and
a consequent longing on his part for more absorbing
work than that of mere subordinate military
routine. Nothing then indicated, however, that
in a short time he would step from such comparative
obscurity to the wide field of European politics
by the acceptance of a hazardous, though pre-eminently
honourable, position of the utmost
importance in Eastern Europe&mdash;the throne of
the United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia,
which, thanks to his untiring exertions
and devotion to duty, are now known as the
Kingdom of Roumania.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In starting on his adventurous, not to say
perilous, experiment, Prince Charles already possessed
plenty of valuable capital to draw upon.
In the first place, few princes to whose lot it has
fallen to sway the destinies of a nation have
received an early training so well adapted to their
future vocation, or have been so auspiciously
endowed by nature with qualities which in
this instance may fairly be said to have been
directly inherited from his parents. His early
and most impressionable years had been passed in
the bosom of an ideally happy and plain-living
family, and this in itself was one of the strongest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
of guarantees for harmonious development and for
future happiness in life. Both his father and
mother had earnestly striven to instil into their
children the difference between the outward
aspect and the true inwardness of things&mdash;the
very essence of training for princes no less than
for those of humbler rank. Also we find the
following significant reference to the Prince and
his feelings on the threshold of his career:</p>

<p>"The stiff and antiquated 'Junker' spirit which
in those days was so prevalent in Prussia and
Berlin, and more particularly at the Prussian
Court, was most repugnant to him. His nature
was too simple, too genuine, for him to take
kindly to this hollow assumption, this clinging to
old-fashioned empty formula. His training had
been too truly aristocratic for him not to be
deeply imbued with simplicity and spontaneity in
all his impulses. His instincts taught him to
value the inwardness of things above their outward
appearance."</p>

<p>Nor was it long before he had ample opportunity
of putting these precepts into practice.
Neither as Prince nor as King has the Sovereign
of Roumania ever permitted prosecution for personal
attacks upon himself. The crime of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lèse
majesté</i> has no existence&mdash;or, to say the least, is
in permanent abeyance&mdash;in Roumania.</p>

<p>Anti-dynastic newspapers have for years persisted
in their attacks upon the King, his policy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
and his person&mdash;sometimes in the most audacious
manner. Although his Ministers have from time
to time strenuously urged his Majesty to authorise
the prosecution of these offenders, he has never
consented to this course. He even refused to
prosecute those who attacked his consort, holding
that the Queen is part of himself, and, like himself,
must be above taking notice of insults, and
must bear the penalty of being misunderstood, or
even calumniated, and trust confidently to the
unerring justice of time for vindication.</p>

<p>The King's equable temperament has enabled
him to take an even higher flight. For let us not
forget that it is possible to be lenient, even forgiving,
in the face of calumny, and yet to suffer
agonies of torture in the task of repressing our
wounded feelings. King Charles is said to have
read many scurrilous pamphlets and papers
directed against him and his dynasty&mdash;for singularly
atrocious examples have been ready to his
hand&mdash;and to have been able sometimes even to
discover a fund of humour in the more fantastic
perversions of truth which they contained.</p>

<p>Speaking of one of the most outrageous personal
attacks ever perpetrated upon him, he is
reported to have said that such things could not
touch or affect him&mdash;that he stood beyond their
reach. Here the words employed by Goethe
regarding his deceased friend Schiller might well
be applied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Und hinter ihm im wesenlosen Scheine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lag, was uns Alle bändigt: das Gemeine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His absolute indifference towards calumny is
doubtless due to his conviction that time will do
him justice&mdash;that a ruler must take his own
course, and that the final estimate is always that
of posterity.</p>

<p>One who for years has lived in close contact with
the Roumanian royal family gives the following
sympathetic and yet obviously sincere description
of the personal impression the King creates:</p>

<p>"King Charles had attained his fiftieth year
when I saw him for the first time. There is, perhaps,
no other stage of life at which a man is so
truly his full self as just this particular age.
The physical development of a man of fifty is
long completed, whereas on the other hand he
has not yet suffered any diminution of strength
or elasticity. His spiritual individuality is also
ripe and complete, in so far as any full, deep
nature can ever be said to have completed its
development. It is only consonant with that
true nobility which precludes every effect borrowed
or based on calculation, that the first
impression the King makes upon the stranger is
not a striking one: he is too distinguished to
attract attention; too genuine to create an effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
for the eye of the many. An artist might admire
the handsome features; but the King lacks the
tall figure, the impressive mien which is the attribute
of the hero of romance, and which excites
the enthusiasm of the crowd. On the other hand,
his slender figure of medium height is elegant
and well knit; his gait is energetic and graceful.
His sea-blue eyes, which lie deep beneath strong
black eyebrows&mdash;meeting right across his aquiline
nose&mdash;now and then take a restless roving expression.
They are those of an eagle, a trite
comparison which has often been made before.
Moreover, their keenness and their great reach of
sight justifies an affinity with the king of birds."</p>

<p>It is not generally known&mdash;but it is true,
nevertheless&mdash;that the King of Roumania is half
French by descent. His grandmother on his
father's side was a Princess Murat, and his
maternal grandmother, as already mentioned, was
a French lady well known to history as Stéphanie
Beauharnais, the adopted daughter of the first
Napoleon, and later, by her marriage, Princess
Stéphanie of Baden. It is to this combination in
his ancestry that people have been wont to
ascribe some of the marked characteristics of the
King. His personal appearance&mdash;notably the
fine clear-cut profile&mdash;undoubtedly recalls the
typical features of the old French nobility. Also
the slight, symmetrical, and graceful figure is
rather French Beauharnais than German Hohenzollern.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
His gift for repartee&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'esprit du moment</i>,
as it is so aptly styled&mdash;is decidedly French; and
perhaps not less so his sanguine temperament,
which has stood him in such good stead, and
encouraged him not to lose heart in the midst
of his greatest troubles, particularly years ago,
when his subjects did not know and value him as
they do now. An abnormal capacity for work and
an absolute indifference towards every form of
material enjoyment&mdash;or gratification of the senses&mdash;have
also singularly fitted him for what posterity
will probably deem to have been King
Charles's most striking vocation: that of the
politician. And his success as a politician is all
the more remarkable, since his youthful training
as well as his early tastes were almost exclusively
those of the Prussian soldier. He even lacked
the study of law and bureaucratic administration,
which are commonly held to be the necessary
groundwork of a political career. Yet not an
atom of German dreaminess is to be detected
in him; nor aught of roughness: little of the
insensible hardness of iron; but rather something
of the fine temper of steel&mdash;the elasticity
of a well-forged blade&mdash;which, though it will
show the slightest breath of damp, and bend at
times, yet flies back rigid to the straight line.
Thus I am assured is King Charles as a politician&mdash;not
to be swayed or tampered with by influences
of any kind, the sober moderation of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
independent judgment has, in fact, never deserted
him. It is also owing to a felicitous temperament
that he has always been able to encounter
opposition&mdash;even bitter enmity&mdash;without feeling
its effect in a way common to average mankind.</p>

<p>He had to begin by acquiring the difficult art
of "taking people," and this&mdash;as the King himself
admits&mdash;he only acquired gradually. However,
he possessed an inborn genius for the
business of ruler. By nature he is a practical
realist whose insatiable appetite for facts, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faits
politiques</i>, crowds out most other interests. So
he quickly profited by experience, which, added to
an independence of judgment which he always
possessed, has made him an opportunist whose
opportunity always means the welfare of his
country. In dealing with public questions he
endeavours to start with the Gladstonian open
mind: <i>i.e.</i>, by having no fixed opinion of his own.
He listens to all&mdash;forms his own opinion in doing
so&mdash;and invariably finishes by impressing and
influencing others. He even indirectly manipulates
public opinion by constantly seeing and
conversing with a vast number of people. For in
Roumania there is no class favouritism so far as
access to the monarch is concerned. Anybody
may be presented at Court, and on any Sunday
afternoon all are at liberty to call and see the
King even without the formality of an audience
paper to fix an appointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Personal favouritism has never existed under
him. In fact, so thoroughly has he realised and
carried into practice what he considers to be his
duty of personal impartiality, that he once vouchsafed
the following justification of an apparent
harshness: that a ruler must take up one and
drop another as the interests of the country require.
In other words, he must not allow personal
feeling to sway him&mdash;whereas in private life he
should never forsake a friend. And yet withal
King Charles is anxiously intent upon avoiding
personal responsibility&mdash;not from timidity, but
from an idea that it is irreconcilable with the
dignity of a constitutional king to put himself
forward in this way. Thus not "Le Roi le veut,"
but rather "I hold it to be in the public
interest that such and such a thing should be
done" is his habitual form of speech in council
with his Ministers.</p>

<p>One of the King's favourite aphorisms is singularly
suggestive in our talkative age: "It is not
so much by what a prince <em>does</em> as by what he <em>says</em>
that he makes enemies!" Like all men of true
genius&mdash;or what the Germans call "geniale
Naturen"&mdash;King Charles is of simple, unaffected
nature;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> without a taint of the histrionic in his
composition, yet gifted with great reserve force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
of self-repression, and rare powers of discernment
and well-balanced judgment.</p>

<p>With all the pride of a Hohenzoller, a sentiment
which he never relinquishes, and which, indeed, is
a constant spur to regulate his conduct by a high
standard, he yet holds that nobody should let a
servant do for him what he can do for himself.
Also, he has ever felt an unaffected liking for
people of humble station who lead useful lives, and
have raised themselves <em>honestly</em> by their own
merit. In fact, the man who works&mdash;however
lowly his sphere of life&mdash;is nearer to his sympathies
than one whose position gives him an excuse for
laziness. He instinctively dislikes the "loafer,"
whatever his birth. He admits as little that
exalted position is an excuse for a useless life as
that it should be put forward to excuse deviation
from the principles of traditional morality. And
in this respect his own life, which has been singularly
marked by what the German language
terms "Sittenreinheit," "purity of morals," offers
an impressive justification for his intolerance upon
this one particular point.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>It is said to be King Charles's earnest conviction
that the maxims he has striven to put into practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
are the only possible ones upon which a monarchy
on a democratic basis can hope to exist in our time.
But here he is obviously attempting to award to
principle what, in this instance at least, must be
largely due to the intuitive gifts of an extraordinary
personality. Maxims are all very well so far
as they go, but they did not go the whole length of
the way. Did not even Immanuel Kant himself
admit that, during a long experience as a tutor,
he had never been able to put those precepts successfully
into practice upon which his work on
"Pädagogik" is founded? Also many of the
difficulties successfully encountered by the King
of Roumania have been of such a nature as cut-and-dry
application of precepts or maxims would
never have sufficed to vanquish. Among these
may be cited the acute crises which from time to
time have been the product of bitter party-warfare
in Roumania. Thus, during the Franco-German
War, when the sympathies of the Roumanian
people were with the French to a man, his position
was one of extreme difficulty. The spiteful enmity
he encountered in those days taxed his endurance
to its utmost limits, and even called forth a
threat of abdication. A weaker man would have
left his post. Again, in 1888, when a peasant
rising brought about by party intrigues seemed
to threaten the results of many years' labour,
even experienced statesmen hinted that the
Hohenzollern dynasty might not last another six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
months. The King was advised to use force and
fire upon the rioters. This he declined to do.
He simply dismissed the Ministry from office, and
called the Opposition into power, and subsequent
events proved that his decision was the right one.
But by far the greatest crisis of his reign, and at
the same time the greatest test of his nerve and
political sagacity, was furnished by the singularly
difficult situation of Roumania during the Russo-Turkish
War of 1877: here, indeed, the very existence
of Roumania was at stake. The situation may
be read between the lines in the present volume.</p>

<p>The King, by virtue of a convention, had
allowed the Russians to march through Roumania,
but the latter had declined an acceptable
alliance which the Roumanians wished for.
When things in Bulgaria went badly with the
Russians, they wanted to call upon some bodies
of Roumanian troops which were stationed on the
banks of the Danube. The King, or, as he was
then, Prince Charles, with the instinct of the
soldier&mdash;and in this case, moreover, of the far-sighted
politician&mdash;was burning to let Roumania
take her share in the struggle. But he was determined
that she should only enter the fray&mdash;if
at all&mdash;as an independent belligerent power.
So he held back&mdash;and held back again, risking the
grave danger which might accrue to Roumania,
and above all to himself, from ultimate Russian
resentment. In the meantime, the Russians were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
defeated in the battles round Plevna; still he held
back; not with a point-blank refusal, but with a
dilatory evasiveness which drove the Russians
nearly frantic. For, during those terrible months
of July and August 1877, in which their soldiers
were dying like flies, they could see the whole Roumanian
army standing ready mobilised, but motionless,
a few hours away to the north, on the Danube&mdash;immovable
in the face of all Muscovite appeals
for assistance. At last the Russians were obliged
to accept Prince Charles's conditions, to agree to
allow him the independent command of all Roumanian
troops, and to place a large corps of Russian
troops besides under his orders. Then, indeed, the
former Prussian lieutenant started within twenty-four
hours, after playing the Russians at their
own game for four months, and beating them at
it to boot. Had Russia refused his demands, not
a single Roumanian would have entered upon that
struggle in the subsequent course of which their
Sovereign covered himself with renown. It was
no part of his business as the ruler of Roumania to
seek military glory <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i>, although the instinct
for such was strong within the Hohenzoller. Also
on the 11th September, the battle of Grivitza&mdash;which
was fought against his advice&mdash;saw him
at his post, and sixteen thousand Russians and
Roumanians<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> were killed and wounded under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
command, probably a greater number slain in
open battle in one day than England has lost in
all her wars since the Crimea! Surely there was
something of the heroic here; and yet it could
hardly weigh as an achievement when compared
with those Fabian tactics which preceded it, and
the execution of which, until the psychological
moment came, called for nerves of steel. Hardly
ever has <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la politique dilatoire</i>&mdash;of which Prince
Bismarck was such a master in his dealings with
Benedetti&mdash;had an apter exponent than King
Charles on this eventful occasion. And its results,
although afterwards curtailed by the
decision of the Berlin Congress, secured the independence
of Roumania and its creation as a
kingdom.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>King Charles is peculiarly German in his
passionate love of nature. At Sinaja&mdash;his
summer residence&mdash;he looks after his trees
with the same solicitude which filled his great
countryman, Prince Bismarck. He spends his
holidays by preference amid romantic scenery&mdash;at
Abbazia, on the blue Adriatic, or in Switzerland.
He visits Ragatz nearly every year,
and thoroughly enjoys his stay among the bluff
Swiss burghers. It is impossible for him to
conceal his identity there; but he does his
best to avoid the dreaded royalty-hunting tourist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
of certain nationalities, and finds an endless fund
of amusement in the rough politeness of the
inhabitants, with their customary greeting:
"<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Herr König, beehren Sie uns bald wieder</i>"&mdash;"Mr.
King, pray honour us again with your
visit."</p>

<p>He also loves to roam at will unknown among
the venerable buildings of towns, such as Vienna
and Munich, to look at the picture and art
galleries, and gather ideas of the way to obtain
for his own people some of those treasures of
culture which he admires in the great centres
of civilisation. He has even, at great personal
sacrifice, collected quite a respectable gallery of
pictures at Bucharest and Sinaja.</p>

<p>If I have dwelt somewhat at length upon the
King's personal characteristics and his political
methods, it has been in order to assist the reader
to appreciate what kind of man he is, and so the
more readily to understand cause and effect in estimating
how the apparently impossible grew into
an accomplished fact. This seemed to be all the
more necessary as the "Reminiscences" themselves&mdash;far
more of a diary than a "Life"&mdash;are conceived
in a spirit of rarely dispassionate impartiality.
The letters, in particular, addressed to the King
by his father&mdash;whilst they afford us a sympathetic
insight into a charming relationship between
father and son&mdash;do credit to the fearless spirit of
the latter in publishing them; and the frankness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
with which the most painful situations are placed
on record can scarcely fail to elicit the sympathy
and respect of the reader. In fact, the book contains
passages which it would trouble the self-love
of many a man to publish. This it is, however,
which stamps it with the invaluable hall-mark of
veracity, whilst, at the same time, it leaves the
reader full liberty to form his own judgment.</p>

KING OF ROUMANIA</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE PRINCIPALITIES OF MOLDAVIA AND
WALLACHIA</h3>


<p class="noind">After the conquest of the Balkan Peninsula by
the Turks, who were intent on extending the
Ottoman Empire even to the north of the Danube,
there was little left for the Roumanian Principalities
of Moldavia and Wallachia, deserted and
abandoned to their fate by the neighbouring
Christian States, except to make the best possible
terms with the victorious followers of the Crescent.
Each Principality, therefore, concluded separate
conventions with the Sublime Porte, by means
of which they aimed at domestic independence
in return for the payment of tribute and military
service. These conventions or capitulations
were not infrequently violated by the Turks as
well as by the Roumanian Hospodars or Princes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Though the rulers of Bucharest and Jassy were
appointed and dismissed at the pleasure of the
Grand Seignior, the very existence of the Principalities
was due solely to the provisions of the
treaties above mentioned, by virtue of which they
escaped incorporation in the Ottoman Empire;
nor were the nobility of Moldavia and Wallachia
forced to follow the example of their equals in
Bosnia and Herzegovina in embracing Islam, in
order to maintain their power over the Christian
population. Still the Principalities of the Danube
did not entirely escape the ruin and misery which
befell Bulgaria and Roumelia; but, since the
forms and outward appearance of administrative
independence remained, it was yet possible that
the Roumanian patriot might develop his country
socially and politically without threatening the
immediate interests of the Turkish Empire south
of the Danube.</p>

<p>Chief amongst the difficulties which beset the
regeneration of Roumania was the rule of the
Phanariotes,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to whom the Porte had practically
handed over the territories of the Lower Danube.
The dignity of Hospodar<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was confined to members
of the great Phanariot families, who oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and misruled the whole country, whilst the Greek
nobles in their train not only monopolised all
offices and dignities, but even poisoned the
national spirit by their corrupt system. Even
to-day Roumania suffers from the after-effects of
Levantine misrule, which blunted the public conscience
and confused all moral conceptions.</p>

<p>Since the end of the eighteenth century the
Danubian Principalities have attracted the unenviable
notice of Russia, whose objective, Constantinople,
is covered by them. In less than a century,
from 1768 to 1854, these unfortunate countries
suffered no less than six Russian occupations, and
as many reconquests by the Turks. It speaks
highly for the national spirit of the Roumanians
that they should have borne the miseries entailed
by these wars without relapsing into abject callousness
and apathy; and that, on the contrary, the
memory of their former national independence
should have continued to gather fresh life, and that
their wish to shake off the yoke of their bondage,
be it Russian or Turkish, should have grown
stronger with the lapse of time. The Hospodars,
appointed by the Russians, were hindered in every
way by the Turks in their task of awakening the
national spirit and preparing the way for the regeneration
of their enslaved people. Besides this, many
of these Hospodars were prejudiced against the
introduction of reforms which could only endanger
their own interests and positions. They were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
therefore, far more disposed to seek the protection
of foreign States than to rely upon the innate
strength of the people they governed. Such were
the causes that hindered the development of the
moral and material resources of the Roumanian
nation.</p>

<p>The ideas from time to time conceived by the
rulers of Russia for the unification of the Principalities
were based solely on selfish aims and
considerations. Thus, for instance, a letter dated
September 10, 1782, from Catherine II., who gave
the Russian Empire its present shape and direction,
to the Emperor Joseph II., shows clearly
that the state then proposed, consisting of
Wallachia, Moldavia and Bessarabia, was to be
merely a Russian outpost, governed by a Russian
nominee, against the Ottoman Empire. Even in
this century (1834) Russia would have been
prepared to further the unification of the Principalities,
if only they and the other Great Powers
had declared themselves content to accept a ruler
drawn from the Imperial House of Russia, or some
closely allied prince. As, however, this was not
the case, the Russian project was laid aside in
favour of a policy of suppressing the national
spirit by means of the Czars influence as protector.
The Sublime Porte, on the other hand,
was straining every nerve to maintain the prevailing
state of affairs. And finally, Austria, the
third neighbour of the Principalities, hesitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
between its desire to gain possession of the mouths
of the Danube by annexing Wallachia and
Moldavia, and its disinclination to increase the
number of its Roumanian subjects by four or five
millions, and thereby to strengthen those incompatible
elements beyond the limits of prudence.
At the same time Austria looked upon the interior
development of Roumania with an even more
unfavourable eye than Russia, and it seemed as
though Moldavia and Wallachia, in spite of the
ever increasing desire of their inhabitants for union
and for the development of their resources, so long
restrained, were condemned to remain for ever in
their lamentable condition by the jealousy of their
three powerful neighbours.</p>

<p>At length came the February Revolution of
1848 in Paris, the effects of which were felt even
in far Roumania. An insurrection arose in
Moldavia: the Hospodar was forced to abdicate;
and a Provisional Government, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lieutenance
Princière</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> was formed at Bucharest, and proceeded
to frame a constitution embodying the
freedom of the Press, the abolition of serfdom and
all the privileges of the nobility. The earlier
state of affairs was, however, restored on September
25 of the same year by the combined
action of the Russians and the Turks, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
result that the Principalities for a time lost even
the last remnants of their former independence,
and the power of the Hospodars was hedged in
with such narrow restrictions by the Treaty of
Balta Liman (May 1, 1849) that they could
undertake no initiative without the sanction of
the Russian and Turkish commissaries, under
whose control they were placed.</p>

<p>The Crimean War brought with it emancipation
from the Russian protectorate, but although the
situation was now improving, much was still
necessary before the Roumanians could regain
their domestic independence. A French protector
had taken the place of the Russian. The
pressure, it is true, was by no means so severe,
nor was it felt so directly as formerly, yet
the country perforce suffered no inconsiderable
damage, both moral and material, from the half-voluntary,
half-compulsory compliance with the
wishes of the French ruler. Napoleon wished to
elevate Roumania, the "Latin sister nation," into
a French dependency, and thereby to make France
the decisive factor in the Oriental question. A
willing tool was found in the person of the new
Hospodar of the now united Principalities, and
thenceforth everything was modelled upon French
pattern.</p>

<p>An international Commission assembled in
Bucharest in 1857, together with a Divan convoked
by an Imperial Firman for Moldavia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Wallachia, to consider the question of the future
position of the Danubian Principalities. The deliberations
of these two bodies, however, resulted
in nothing, as neither the Sublime Porte nor the
Great Powers were inclined to agree to the programme
submitted to them, the main features of
which were: the union of the two Principalities
as a neutral, autonomous state under the hereditary
sovereignty of a prince of a European
dynasty, and the introduction of a constitution.
A conference held at Paris, on the other hand,
decided that each Principality should elect a
native Hospodar, subject to the Sultan's confirmation.</p>

<p>The desire for national unity had, however,
become so strong that the newly elected legislative
bodies of both countries rebelled against the
decision of the Great Powers, and elected Colonel
Alexander Kusa as their ruler in 1859. Personal
union was thus achieved, though the election of a
foreign prince had, for the time being, to be
abandoned. Still Prince Kusa was required to
pledge his word to abdicate should an opportunity
arrive for the closer union of the two
countries under the rule of a foreign prince.</p>

<p>Guided by the advice of the Great Powers, the
Sultan confirmed the election of Prince Kusa, but
by means of <em>two</em> Firmans, a diplomatic sleight of
hand, by which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i> of the irregular
union remained undisturbed, albeit unrecognised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Formal sanction to the union was not conceded by
the Sublime Porte until 1861. Prince Kusa,
whose private life was by no means above reproach,
endeavoured to fulfil in public the
patriotic ambition of furthering his people's progress.
But Roumania at that period was not
prepared for the purely parliamentary form of
government it had assumed, and the well-meant
reforms initiated by the Prince and the Chamber
achieved no immediate result. Prince Kusa,
therefore, felt himself compelled to abolish the
Election Laws by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i>, and to frame a
new one, which obtained the sanction of the
Sublime Porte, and eventually the approval of the
majority of the nation.</p>

<p>The increased liberty of action gained by the
Prince was utilised to the full in formulating a
series of necessary and excellent reforms; he
failed, however, to place the budget on a satisfactory
footing, and the finances remained in the
same unfavourable condition as before, whilst
several of his measures were directly opposed to
the interests of certain factions and classes of the
population. In addition to these difficulties,
scandals arose which were based only too firmly
upon the extremely lax life which Prince Kusa
led, and a conspiracy was formed for his overthrow
which found a ready support throughout
the land. The Palace at Bucharest was surprised
on the night of February 22, 1866, by a band of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
armed men, who forced the Prince to abdicate
and quit the country. This accomplished, the
leaders of the various parties assembled and
formed a Provisional Government under the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lieutenance Princière</i>, or regency, which consisted
of General N. Golesku, Colonel Haralambi and
Lascar Catargiu.</p>

<p>The Chamber at once proceeded to elect a new
ruler, and their first choice fell upon the Count of
Flanders, the younger brother of the King of
Belgium. Napoleon III., however, who was then
still able to play the arbitrator in the affairs of
Europe, hinted that the Count would be better
advised to decline the proffered crown. The
Emperor's wish was acceded to, and, although
the Provisional Government for a time appeared
to persist in the election of the Count of Flanders,
Roumania was ultimately forced to look for a
candidate whose election would not be opposed
by any of the Great Powers.</p>

<p>The choice was difficult, if not impossible; for
the Paris Conference, which had reassembled in
the meantime, had decided against the union of the
Principalities; and, unless Roumania could attain
its object semi-officially by the favour of the Great
Powers, the position was hopeless.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a serious, not to say alarming,
situation; for a war between Prussia and Austria
for the hegemony of Germany was imminent, and
threatened to lead to further complications in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
East. If the election were delayed until after the
outbreak of hostilities, one of the belligerent parties
was certain to reject the candidate whose election
the other approved, whilst Russia would take
advantage of the interregnum to stir up the
whole of Roumania, especially Moldavia, against
the union; for anything that might tend to
impede the Russian advance upon Constantinople
could not fail to evoke the most lively hostility
in St. Petersburg. It was, therefore, upon
France and her Emperor that all the hopes
of the Roumanians reposed: with Napoleon on
their side everything was possible, without him
nothing.</p>

<p>The leading Roumanian statesmen were well
aware of the difficulties in the way, and eventually
fixed upon Prince Charles of Hohenzollern as their
candidate, for he was related to both the French
and Prussian dynasties, upon whose goodwill and
support he might confidently reckon. It was of
the utmost importance, therefore, to move him
to accept their offer at once, and to obtain the
sanction of the nation by a <i>plébiscite</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE SUMMONS TO THE THRONE</h3>


<p class="noind">The Roumanian delegate, Joan Bratianu, arrived
at Düsseldorf on Good Friday 1866, to lay the
offer of the Roumanian people before Prince
Charles and his father. In an audience granted
by the latter on the following day, March 31,
Bratianu announced the intention of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lieutenance
Princière</i>, inspired by Napoleon III., to
advance Prince Charles Anthony's second son,
Charles, as a candidate for the throne of the Principalities.
Bratianu succeeded in obtaining a private
interview with Prince Charles the same evening,
in order to acquaint the latter with the political
situation, and to point out the danger which must
inevitably be incurred if the present Provisional
Government remained in power. Prince Charles
replied that he possessed courage enough to
accept the offer, but feared that he was not equal
to the task, adding that nothing was known of
the intentions of the King of Prussia, without
whose permission, as chief of the family, he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
not take so important a step. He therefore
declined for the moment to give any definite
answer to the proposals of the Roumanian Government.
Bratianu returned to Paris, after
promising to take no immediate steps in the
matter. Prince Charles Anthony without delay
addressed a memorial regarding this offer to the
King of Prussia, and clearly defined the circumstances
which had led to his taking this step. A
similar communication was forwarded to the
President of the Prussian Ministry.</p>

<p>A few days later Prince Charles arrived in
Berlin, and at once visited the King, the Crown
Prince, and Prince Frederick Charles, as he reported
in a letter to his father:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The King made no mention of the Roumanian
question at the interview, but the Crown Prince,
on the other hand, entered into a minute discussion
with me, and did not appear to be at all
against the idea. The only thing that displeased
him was that the candidature was inspired by
France, as he feared that the latter might demand
a rectification of the frontier from Prussia in return
for this good office. I replied that I did not
consider that the Emperor Napoleon had thought
of such a bargain, but had been induced to take
the initiative in this matter by family feeling rather
than by any selfish consideration. The Crown
Prince, moreover, considered it a great honour that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
so difficult a task had been offered to a member of the
House of Hohenzollern. Prince Frederick Charles
also at once started upon a minute discussion of
the Roumanian question. He seemed to be intimately
acquainted with the issue, and volunteered
the opinion that I was intended for better things
than to rule tributary Principalities: he therefore
advised me to decline the offer."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following telegram, published in the Press,
was handed to Prince Charles as he was sitting
with his comrades at the regimental mess-table:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Bucharest</span>, <i>13th April</i>.
</p>

<p>"The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lieutenance Princière</i> and Ministry have
announced the candidature of Prince Charles of
Hohenzollern as Prince of Roumania, under the
title of Charles I., by means of placards at the
street corners; it is rumoured that the Prince will
arrive here shortly. The populace appeared delighted
by the news."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Prince at once visited Colonel von Rauch,
who had been entrusted with the delivery of
Prince Charles Anthony's memorial to the King,
and learnt that an answer would be sent on
April 16. The following report was despatched
to Prince Charles Anthony by his messenger on
the 14th: "I was commanded to attend their
Majesties at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soirée Musicale</i> yesterday
evening. The King took me into a side room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and expressed himself as follows: 'I have not
yet replied to the Prince, because I am still
waiting for news from Paris, as the Porte
has declared its intention of recalling its ambassador
from the Conference if the election of
a foreign prince is discussed.</p>

<p>"'Should the protecting States have regard to
this declaration of the Porte, the election of a
Hohenzollern prince would be rendered impossible;
on the other hand, should the majority decide for
a foreign prince, and the coming Chamber in
Bucharest follow their example, the whole matter
would enter upon a new phase. However, that I
may not keep the Prince waiting, I shall express
my opinions shortly as to the future acceptance or
refusal of the Roumanian crown.'"</p>

<p>The King of Prussia forwarded the following
autograph letter to the young Hohenzollern prince
early the next morning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your father has, no doubt, imparted to you
the enclosed (telegram from Bratianu). You will
remain quite passive. Great obstacles have arisen,
as Russia and the Porte are so far opposed to a
foreign prince.</p>

<p class="sig">
"WILLIAM."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The telegram ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Five million Roumanians proclaim Prince
Charles, the son of your Royal Highness, as their
sovereign. Every church is open, and the voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the clergy rises with that of the people in prayer
to the Eternal, that their Elected may be blessed
and rendered worthy of his ancestors and the
trust reposed in him by the whole nation.</p>

<p class="sig">
"J. C. BRATIANU."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The long expected reply from the Prussian
monarch arrived at Düsseldorf on April 16. After
discussing the probable moral and material bonds
of union which would unite Prussia and Roumania
in the event of the offer being accepted, the King
continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The question is whether the position of your
son and his descendants would really be as favourable
as might otherwise be expected? For the
present the ruler of Roumania will continue as a
vassal of the Porte. Is this a dignified and
acceptable position for a Hohenzollern? And
though it may be expected that in future this
position will be exchanged for that of an independent
sovereignty, still the date of the realisation
of this aim is very remote, and will probably be
preceded by political convulsions through which
the ruler of the Danubian Principalities might
perhaps be unable to retain his position! With
such an outlook, are not the present position and
prospects of your son happier than the life which
is offered him?</p>

<p>"Even in the event of my consenting to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
election of one of your sons to the throne of
Roumania, is there any guarantee that this elective
sovereignty, even if it becomes hereditary,
will remain faithful to him who is now chosen?
The past of these countries shows the contrary;
and the experience of other States, ancient and
well established, as well as newly created and
elective empires, shows how uncertain such structures
are in our times.</p>

<p>"But, above all, we must take into consideration
the attitude of the Powers represented at the
Paris Conference to this question of election.
Two questions still remain undecided: (<i>a</i>) Is
there to be an union or not? (<i>b</i>) Is there to be a
foreign Prince or not?</p>

<p>"Russia and the Porte are against the union,
but it appears that England will join the majority,
and if she decides for the union the Porte will be
obliged to submit.</p>

<p>"In the same way both the former States are
opposed to the election of a foreign Prince as the
ruler of the Danubian Principalities. I have mentioned
this attitude of the Porte, and yesterday
we received a message from Russia to say that it
was not disposed to agree to the project of your
son's election, and that it will demand a resumption
of the Conference. All these events prevent
the hope of a simple solution. I must therefore
urge you to consider these matters again. Even
should Russia, against its will of course, consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to the election of a foreign Prince, it is to be
expected that intrigue after intrigue will take
place in Roumania between Russia and Austria.
And since Austria will more willingly vote for
such an election, Roumania would be forced to
rely upon her as against Russia, and so the newly
created country with its dynasty would be on the
side of the chief opponent of Prussia, though the
latter is to provide the Prince!</p>

<p>"You will gather from what I have said that,
from dynastic and political considerations, I do not
consider this important question quite as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couleur
de rose</i> as you do. In any case we must await the
news which the next few days will bring us from
Bucharest, St. Petersburg, and Constantinople, and
we must see whether the Paris Conference will
reassemble immediately.</p>

<p>
"Your faithful Cousin and Friend,</p>
<p class="sig">"WILLIAM."
</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;A note received to-day from the French
Ambassador proves that the Emperor Napoleon is
favourably inclined to the plan. This is very
important. The position will only be tenable if
Russia agrees, as she is influential in Roumania
on account of her professing the same religion
and owing to her geographical proximity and
old associations. These constitute an influence
against which a new Prince in a weak and divided
country would not be able to contend for any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
length of time. If you are desirous of prosecuting
this affair your son must, above all things, gain
the consent of Russia. It is true that up to now
the prospect of success is remote...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Prince Charles Anthony replied, assuring the
King that, although the examples of such enterprises
in Greece and Mexico had proved disastrous,
yet the complications which might arise from
Roumania were not likely to affect the prestige
of Prussia, and he therefore begged his Majesty
not to refuse his consent so long as there was a
chance of arranging the matter. A most important
interview then took place between Count
Bismarck and Prince Charles at the Berlin residence
of the former, who was at that time confined
to his house by illness.</p>

<p>Bismarck opened the conversation with the
words: "I have requested your Serene Highness
to visit me, not in order to converse with you as a
statesman, but quite openly and freely as a friend
and an adviser, if I may use the expression. You
have been unanimously elected by a nation to rule
over them; obey the summons. Proceed at once
to the country, to the government of which you
have been called!"</p>

<p>Prince Charles replied that this course was
out of the question, unless the King gave his
permission, although he felt quite equal to the
task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"All the more reason," replied the Count. "In
this case you have no need for the direct permission
of the King. Ask the King for leave&mdash;leave
to travel abroad. The King (I know him well)
will not be slow to understand, and to see
through your intention. You will, moreover,
remove the decision out of his hands, a most
welcome relief to him, as he is politically tied
down. Once abroad, you resign your commission
and proceed to Paris, where you will ask the
Emperor for a private interview. You might
then lay your intentions before Napoleon, with the
request that he will interest himself in your affairs
and promote them amongst the Powers. In my
opinion this is the only method of tackling the
matter, if your Serene Highness thinks at all of
accepting the crown in question. On the other
hand, should this question come before the Paris
Conference, it will not take months merely, but even
years to settle. The two Powers most interested&mdash;Russia
and the Porte&mdash;will protest emphatically
against your election; France, England, and
Italy will be on your side, whilst Austria will
make every endeavour to ruin your candidature.
From Austria there is, however, not much to fear,
as I propose to give her occupation for some time
to come!... As regards us, Prussia is placed
in the most difficult position of all: on account of
her political and geographical situation she has
always held aloof from the Eastern Question and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
has only striven to make her voice heard in the
Council of the Powers. In this particular case,
however, I, as Prussian Minister, should have to
decide against you, however hard it would be for
me, for at the present moment I must not come to
a rupture with Russia, nor pledge our State
interest for the sake of family interest. By independent
action on the part of your Highness the
King would escape this painful dilemma; and,
although he cannot give his consent as head of the
family, I am convinced that he will not be against
this idea, which I would willingly communicate
to him if he would do me the honour of visiting
me here. When once your Serene Highness is in
Roumania the question would soon be solved; for
when Europe is confronted by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i> the
interested Powers will, it is true, protest, but the
protest will be only on paper, and the fact cannot
be undone!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Prince then pointed out that Russia and
Turkey might adopt offensive measures, but
Bismarck denied this possibility: "The most
disastrous contingencies, especially for Russia,
might result from forcible measures. I advise
your Serene Highness to write an autograph letter
to the Czar of Russia before your departure, saying
that you see in Russia your most powerful
protector, and that with Russia you hope some
day to solve the Eastern Question. A matrimonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
alliance also might be mooted, which would give
you great support in Russia."</p>

<p>In reply to a question as to the attitude of
Prussia to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>, Bismarck declared:
"We shall not be able to avoid recognising the
fact and devoting our full interest to the matter.
Your courageous resolve is therefore certain to be
received here with applause."</p>

<p>The Prince then asked whether the Count
advised him to accept the crown, or whether it
would be better to let the matter drop.</p>

<p>"If I had not been in favour of the course proposed,
I should not have permitted myself to
express my views," was the reply. "I think the
solution of the question by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i> will be
the luckiest and most honourable for you. And
even if you do not succeed your position with
regard to the House of Prussia would continue
the same. You would remain here and be able to
look back with pleasure to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i> with which you
could never reproach yourself. But if you succeed,
as I think you will, this solution would be of
incalculable value to you; you have been elected
unanimously by the vote of the nation in the
fullest sense of the word; you follow this summons
and thereby from the commencement earn the full
confidence of the whole nation."</p>

<p>The Prince objected that he could not quite
trust the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plébiscite</i>, because it had been effected
so quickly, but Bismarck replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"The surest guarantee can be given you by the
deputation which will shortly be sent to you, and
which you must not receive on Prussian territory;
moreover, I should place myself in communication
with the Roumanian agent in Paris as soon as
possible. I communicated this idea <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous discrétion</i>
to the French Ambassador, Benedetti, after we
had learnt that Napoleon wished to hear our views,
and he declares that France will place a ship at
your disposal to undertake the journey to Roumania
from Marseilles, but I think it would be
better to make use of the ordinary steamer in order
to keep the matter quite secret."</p>

<p>As in duty bound, Prince Charles proceeded to
the Royal Palace after this interview, to ascertain
the King's views on the proposed course of action.
His Majesty did not share Count Bismarck's view
and thought that the Prince had better await
the decision of the Paris Conference, although,
even should this be favourable, it would still be
unworthy a Prince of the House of Hohenzollern
to place himself under the suzerainty of the Sultan!
To this Prince Charles replied that, although he
was ready to acknowledge the Turkish suzerainty
for a time, he reserved to himself the task of
freeing his country by force of arms, and of gaining
perfect independence on the field of battle. The
King gave the Prince leave to proceed to Düsseldorf,
embraced him heartily, and bade him Godspeed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Bismarck sent for Colonel Rauch, who had
played an important part in the negotiations with
the King, and informed him on April 23 that the
Paris Conference had decided by five votes to
three that the Bucharest Chamber was to elect a
native prince, and that France had declared that
she would not tolerate forcible measures either on
the part of Russia or of the Porte. The President
of the Prussian Ministry then repeated the advice
he had given to Prince Charles, viz., to accept the
election at once, then proceed to Paris, and thence
to Bucharest with the support of Napoleon, and
to write at once to the Czar Alexander, hinting at
the projected Russian marriage. If Russia was
won, everything would be won, and the intervention
by force of one or the other of the guaranteeing
Powers would be no longer to be feared. As
regards the consent of the King, which of course
could not be given now, it would not be refused to
a final <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>. Prince Charles must decide
for himself whether he felt the power and decision
to solve the problem in this straightforward
fashion; but it must be understood that no other
method offered any prospect, for the Powers would
eventually agree upon a native prince, and the
Roumanians must submit. "I spoke," he added,
"to the Roumanian political agent in Paris,
M. Balaceanu, in a similar strain yesterday evening,
and laid stress upon the fact that the King cannot
at present decide or accept the election of Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Charles, because political complications might be
created thereby."</p>

<p>From Paris came the news that nothing would
be more agreeable to the Emperor and his Government
than to see Prince Charles on the throne of
Roumania, but that nothing could be done in the
face of the decision of the Conference, and that
the Prince's project of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i> was so
adventurous that the Emperor could not promise
his support. An interview was then arranged at
the house of Baroness Franque in Ramersdorf,
with M. Balaceanu, who declared that the intention
of the Roumanian Government was to adhere to its
choice, and, if necessary, to carry on the government
under the name of Charles I. Roumania
would allow herself neither to be bent nor broken.</p>

<p>Two days later, on April 29, Colonel von Rauch
returned from Berlin with the royal answer to
Prince Charles Anthony's second memorial, which
contained a repetition of the King's objections to
the acceptance of the offer, and still more to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>, which was so warmly urged from
Paris. The "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Memorial Diplomatique</i>" of the 28th
contained this suggestive phrase: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">... l'initiative
de la France n'a pour object que les faits à
accomplir!</i>"</p>

<p>Prince Charles Anthony received M. Bratianu
and Dr. Davila on May 1 at Düsseldorf. They
came to announce the arrival of the deputation
with the verification of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plébiscite</i>, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
inquire whether or no Prince Charles intended to
decline their offer definitely. It was then decided
to telegraph in cipher to Bucharest that the Prince
had decided to accept the offer, but only on condition
that the King should give his consent.</p>

<p>In answer to a telegram from Prince Charles
Anthony, the King of Prussia begged him to come
to Berlin to discuss the question of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>.
The result of the interview was that the King
agreed to refrain from influencing the decision of
Prince Charles directly and to permit the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait
accompli</i> to "take place." The Prince was to
resign his commission as a Prussian officer after
passing the Prussian frontier.</p>

<p>On the receipt of this news from Berlin, the
Prince at once sent for MM. Balaceanu and Bratianu,
and on their arrival informed them that he was
prepared to set out for Roumania without delay.
The question then arose as to which route was to
be taken, since Prussia might declare war any
day with Austria, whilst a sea journey <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viâ</i>
Marseilles or Genoa risked a possible detention
at Constantinople. The Prince eventually decided
on the shortest route, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viâ</i> Vienna-Basiasch; but
this plan had to be reconsidered, as owing to an
indiscretion the proposed itinerary became public.</p>

<p>The long expected mobilisation order of the
Prussian Army was signed by the King on
May 9, and Prince Charles in consequence received
an order from his colonel to rejoin his regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
at once, from which, however, he was exempted
by the six weeks' leave granted by the King
himself. Balaceanu urged the Prince by letter
not to delay his departure, and reiterated his
entreaties on behalf of the Roumanian people,
who were anxiously awaiting the arrival of their
chosen ruler.</p>

<p>The last day at home was Friday, May 11,
1866, and with it came the inevitable anguish of
parting with his dearly loved parents. Repressing
the emotions which might otherwise have
betrayed the pregnant measure he had undertaken,
Prince Charles, clad for the last time in
the uniform of the Prussian Dragoons, rode down
the avenue towards Benrath Castle, where his
eldest brother resided and awaited him. Upon
arriving there, he exchanged his uniform for mufti
and proceeded to the station with his sister,
Princess Marie, who accompanied him for the first
few hours of his journey, and at Bonn the Prince
joined Councillor von Werner, with whom the
momentous journey was to be undertaken.
Zurich was reached at two o'clock in the afternoon,
when the travellers broke their journey for
the first time in order to arrange the difficult
question of passports. Von Werner telegraphed to
a Swiss official, whom Prince Charles Anthony had
already asked about the passes, to arrange a meeting
at St. Gallen, but as the official was not at
home at the time, a delay of twenty-four hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
occurred, which Prince Charles spent in writing to
the Emperors of Russia and France and the Sultan
of Turkey.</p>

<p>Baron von Mayenfisch and Lieutenant Linche,
a Roumanian staff officer, who both joined the
party in Zurich, set out independently, the former
for Munich, the latter for Basiasch on the Danube.
The Prince and Von Werner occupied themselves
with erasing the marking of the Prince's linen
and reducing the quantity of his baggage to
indispensable limits. The following day (May 14)
found the Prince and his companion at St. Gallen,
where a passport was obtained for the former
under the name of "Karl Hettingen," travelling
on business to Odessa, and at the Prince's request
a note was made on this document of the fact
that Herr Hettingen wore spectacles. The
acquisition of these passports, however, and the
fact of his travelling second-class, were not alone
sufficient to overcome all further difficulties and
dangers, for on reaching Salzburg, on the Austro-Bavarian
frontier, on the 16th, a customs official
gruffly demanded the Prince's name, and he to
his horror found that he had forgotten it.
Luckily Von Werner, with great presence of
mind, flung himself into the breach by insisting
on paying duty for some cigars, and so diverted
the intruder's attention, whilst the Prince refreshed
his peccant memory with a glimpse at his
passport. But this was not all, for scarcely had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
this little manœuvre been successfully carried out
than several officers of the "King of Belgium's"
Regiment, with whom the Prince had served in
1864 in Denmark, entered the waiting-room and
caused him no little misgiving lest he should be
recognised. Here fortune, however, again favoured
him, and all passed off well, the travellers continuing
their journey as far as Vienna, which they
found crowded with troops. Pressburg, Pest,
Szegedin and Temesvar found them still caged in
the dismal squalor of a dirty second-class carriage,
and suffering much discomfort from an icy wind
which chilled them to the bone. The tedious
railway journey at length ended at Basiasch, from
whence they were to proceed down stream by
steamer. The mobilisation of the Austrian troops
had, however, completely disorganised the river
service, and a most unwelcome delay of two days
took place at this unsavoury spot.</p>

<p>Joan Bratianu arrived from Paris in time to
accompany his future sovereign upon the last
stage of his journey, but, as strict secrecy was
still imperative, he was compelled to treat the
Prince as a stranger. The Roumanian frontier
was reached at last, and the boat lay alongside
the quay of Turnu Severin. As the Prince was
about to hurry on shore, the master of the steamboat
stopped him to inquire why he should land
here when he wanted to go to Odessa. The
Prince replied that he only intended to spend a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
few minutes on shore, and then hurried forward.
As soon as he touched Roumanian soil, Bratianu,
hat in hand, requested his Prince to step into one
of the carriages waiting there. And as he did so
he heard the captain's voice exclaim: "By God,
that must be the Prince of Hohenzollern!"</p>

<p>After the despatch of a couple of telegrams to
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lieutenance Princière</i> and the Government,
the Prince and Bratianu set out for the capital
in a carriage drawn by eight horses at a hand
gallop, which never slackened its headlong pace
throughout the ice-cold, misty night. At four
o'clock they reached the river Jiu, but lost some
time there, as the ferry was not in working order.
At Krajowa, where the news of his arrival had
brought together an enormous and enthusiastic
multitude, a right royal welcome awaited the new
Prince, and, escorted by two sections of Dorobanz
Cavalry (Militia hussars), he reached the prettily
decorated town of Slatina at noon, where a halt
of a couple of hours was made before proceeding
to Piteschti. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En route</i> the Prince overtook the
2nd Line Regiment marching on Bucharest, and
was greeted by them with enthusiastic cheers. A
numerous escort of cavaliers, amongst them Dr.
Davila, met the Prince outside Piteschti, where
yet another most enthusiastic reception was
accorded him. General Golesku and Jon Ghika,
the President of the Ministry, were presented to
the Prince, who expressed his pleasure at greeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the first members of the Government. The night
was passed at Goleschti, where the Prince entered
upon his duties by signing a decree pardoning the
Metropolitan of Moldavia for his share in the
Separatist riots of April 15. Prince Charles rose
early the following morning to make all necessary
arrangements for his triumphal entry into the
capital, where the inhabitants were waiting
impatiently to do him honour. The keys of the
town were presented by the Burgomaster, who
also addressed a speech to the new ruler. The
procession then passed along the streets lined by
soldiers of the Line and National Guard, until
they reached a house outside which a guard of
honour was posted. "What house is that?"
asked the Prince in the innocence of his heart.
"That is the Palace," replied General Golesku
with embarrassment. Prince Charles thought he
had misunderstood him, and asked: "<em>Where</em> is
the Palace?" The General, still more embarrassed,
pointed in silence to the one-storeyed
building.</p>

<p>At length the procession halted at the Metropolie,
the Cathedral of Bucharest, where the
venerable Metropolitan received the Prince and
tendered him the Cross and Bible to kiss. After
hearing the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i>, the Prince, with his suite,
proceeded to the Chamber, which stands exactly
opposite the Metropolie. Here he took the oath
to keep the laws, maintain the rights, and preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the integrity of Roumania.&mdash;"Jur de a pazi
legile Romaniei, d'a mentine drepturile sale si
integritateā teritoriului!"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Then, after replying
in French to the address of the President of the
Chamber, Prince Charles repaired with his suite
to the Palace to refresh himself after the exertions
of the day. The rooms, though small, proved to
have been tastefully furnished by Parisian
upholsterers during the government of Prince
Kusa, but the view from the windows was primitive
indeed; on the one side stood an insignificant
guardhouse, whilst the other offered the national
spectacle of a gipsy encampment with its herd of
swine wallowing in the gutters of the main road&mdash;it
could hardly be called a street. Such were
the surroundings amongst which the adventurous
Hohenzollern Prince commenced his new career!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>STORM AND STRESS</h3>


<p class="noind">The first Roumanian Ministry under the new
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> was composed of members of all political
parties, Conservatives and Liberals, Moldavians
and Wallachians, Right, Centre, and Left. Lascar
Catargui was appointed President of the Ministry,
which, amongst others, included Joan Bratianu
(Finance), Petre Mavrogheni (Foreign Affairs),
General Prince<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Jon Ghika (War), and Demeter
Sturdza (Public Works).</p>

<p>The chief task of the new Government was to
secure the recognition of their new ruler by the
Powers, but the telegrams from the Roumanian
agents abroad showed very plainly that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait
accompli</i> was only the first step towards the
desired end. The initiative of the Prince found
favour, it is true, with Napoleon, but his Minister,
Drouyn de L'Huys, regarded his action as an insult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to the Paris Conference, whilst the Sultan refused
to receive the letter addressed to him by Prince
Charles, and announced his intention of applying
to the Conference for sanction to occupy the
Principalities by armed force. To meet this
possibility, the immediate mobilisation of the
Roumanian Army was decided upon by the
Cabinet, and the Prince seized an occasion for
reviewing the troops on May 24. The Turkish
protest against the election was submitted
to the Conference on the following day, but
the Powers decided that Turkey was not
entitled to occupy Roumanian territory without
the previous consent of the Powers, and also
declared that they had broken off official communications
with the Prince's Government. As
the news from Constantinople became more and
more threatening, a credit of eight million francs
was voted by the Roumanian Chamber for warlike
purposes, and orders were issued for the
concentration of the frontier battalions and
Dorobanz Cavalry. The former, however, mutinied
and refused to leave their garrisons, whilst an
inspection of the arsenal showed that there was
scarcely enough powder in the magazines for more
than a few rounds to each soldier.</p>

<p>The deputation sent to conciliate Russia met
with a cold reception from Prince Gortchakoff,
who complained that France had been consulted
before the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>. He further remonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
against the collection of Polish refugees on the
Roumanian frontier. On the other hand, he
did not appear averse from an alliance between
Prince Charles and the Russian Imperial family.
Bismarck received the members of the deputation
with cordiality, and recommended them to assume
an anti-Austrian attitude in the event of an insurrection
in Hungary. In the meantime, the Paris
Conference declined to appoint commissaries for
the Principalities, as had been done formerly
under the Hospodars, and practically decided to
leave Roumania an open question.</p>

<p>The finances of the Principalities were completely
disorganised, as the Public Treasury was
empty, the floating debt amounted to close on
seven millions sterling, and it seemed as though
the year 1866 would indicate a deficit of another
six millions. To complete the financial ruin of
the country, a proposal to create paper money
was set on foot, but was thrown out by the
Chamber.</p>

<p>The chief measure laid before the Chamber was
the draft of a new Constitution. The Prince
insisted upon an Upper and a Lower House as
well as upon an unconditional and absolute veto,
whilst the Chamber wished to grant a merely
suspensive veto, such as is exercised by the
President of the United States of America.
Owing in great part to the efforts of Prince
Charles, the report of the Committee upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Constitution was presented on June 28, when a
series of heated debates arose on the question
of granting political rights to the Roumanian
Jews. The excitement spread rapidly throughout
Bucharest, and a riotous mob destroyed the newly
erected synagogue. Thereupon, the unpopular
sections of the Constitution were hastily abandoned
by the Government in deference to the wishes of
the Jews themselves. A better fate, however,
befell the veto question, which was decided in
favour of the Prince, and on July 11 the Constitution
was unanimously passed through the
Chamber by ninety-one votes.</p>

<p>On the following day the Prince proceeded, with
the same ceremonies as before, to the Metropolie
to attend the Te Deum before taking the oath to
the new Constitution in the Chamber. He then
seized the opportunity of reminding the representatives
of the nation that Roumania's chief
object must be to remain neutral and on good
terms with the neighbouring Powers.</p>

<p>The Prince's daily routine at this period was
calculated to tax to the utmost even his abnormal
energy and strength. After a ride in the early
morning, the correspondence of the day was gone
through before the Ministers were received. Then
followed miscellaneous audiences, and the inspection
of some Government institution or school in
Bucharest. The organisation of the Ministries
and Courts of Justice was modelled on those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
France: the hospitals, thanks to the liberality of
former Hospodars, were well endowed, and able to
treat patients free of charge. In many cases,
however, the hospital buildings were insanitary;
the prisons were in the most unsatisfactory condition,
the food of the prisoners was of very
indifferent quality, while, last, but by no means
least, among the many points which demanded
his close attention at this time, was the question
of barracks and military establishments. At
six o'clock the Prince dined with his household,
and often some ten or twelve guests of opposite
political opinions were invited, in order that he
might become more closely acquainted with the
views of the various parties. As, however,
punctuality was at that time a custom more
honoured in the breach than the observance in
Bucharest, it frequently happened that the Prince
had to commence dinner without one or other of
his guests. After dinner Prince Charles generally
drove along the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaussée</i>, which, enclosed on either
side by handsome gardens, formed the rendezvous
of the fashion of the capital. On other days the
Prince rode to one or other of the numerous
monasteries and cloisters in the neighbourhood,
such as Cernika, the burial-place of the Metropolitans,
Pasere and Caldaruschan.</p>

<p>Prince Jon Ghika returned from Constantinople
on the 15th of July with a draft of the conditions
upon which the Porte was willing to recognise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Prince Charles. A Council of Ministers was
assembled the same evening to consider this project,
which was then unanimously rejected, and a
counter-project was drawn up and discussed in all
its bearings on the 17th. The main features in
dispute were as follows: The Porte wished to
retain the name of the "United Principalities of
Wallachia and Moldavia," whilst the Ministry
were in favour of either "Roumania" or "The
United Roumanian Principalities." The Porte
declared that the princely dignity must continue
to be elective, whilst the Roumanians in return
demanded the recognition of the right of hereditary
succession and, in the absence of a direct
descendant of the Prince, his brother's family was
to succeed. In reply to the Turkish demand for
military aid in any war, the Ministry declared that
Roumania would only render assistance in a
defensive war. The proposal of the Porte to send
an agent to protect Turkish interests in the
Principalities was rejected entirely, as was also
the demand that Roumania should neither coin
money nor confer decorations.</p>

<p>Acting on his father's maxim, "A wise and an
honest ruler must never pursue a personal policy,
but only a national one," Prince Charles declined
to countenance a rebellion in Hungary advocated
at a private interview by General Türr, the well-known
Hungarian patriot and agitator. A similar
course was pursued with regard to a Servian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
deputation, which assured the Prince that all the
Eastern Christians rested upon him their hopes of
deliverance from the Turkish yoke.</p>

<p>The first Ministerial crisis occurred on July 25,
1866, owing to the financial troubles and the
disagreement existing between the President and
MM. Bratianu and Rossetti. The Prince confided
the task of forming the new Ministry to Jon
Ghika, who had proved himself an able and
energetic diplomat in conducting the negotiations
with the Porte.</p>

<p>In the midst of these difficulties the sorrowful
news of the death of his brother Anthony, from
wounds received at Königgrätz, reached the
Prince early on August 7. The sympathy which
this family event evoked amongst all classes of
the Roumanian nation was the surest proof of the
affection and regard already inspired by their new
ruler. Ministers, municipal authorities, officers
of the Army and Militia, and all the notabilities
of the country hastened to express their
sympathy with the Prince's family in the warmest
manner.</p>

<p>The serious condition of the finances forced the
Prince to diminish the strength of the Army by
7000 men, although the attitude of the Porte
still rendered it advisable to concentrate all available
forces. Prince Charles also addressed the
following letter to the Emperor Napoleon to induce
him to favour a Roumanian loan in Paris:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In accepting the throne of Roumania, I knew
that the duties devolving on me were enormous:
still I confess that the difficulties to be surmounted
are even greater than I thought.</p>

<p>"The most complete disorder in the finances as
well as in all the branches of the Administration
gives rise to difficulties against which I have to
struggle every day, and which render my task
extremely painful....</p>

<p>"A greater power than that of man&mdash;the
Divine&mdash;sends us fresh trials. The whole country,
especially Moldavia, is threatened with a famine....
The only means of succouring the populace
is by means of a loan.... Trusting, Sire, in the
affectionate sentiments of your Majesty, I ask
you for the aid of your all-powerful goodwill,
because it is the knowledge of your Majesty's
constant goodwill to the Roumanians and, I
venture to say, to me personally, that has sustained
me in the midst of the difficulties with which I
have had to contend...."</p>

<p>The Prince concluded with the words: "The
happiness of the Roumanian nation has become
the aim of my life: I have devoted to this mission
all my time and all my aspirations."</p></blockquote>

<p>Owing to the active support of France, the
Sublime Porte declared its willingness to concede
certain points of the Roumanian counter-project,
such as the election of the Prince, the hereditary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
succession in the Prince's family, and the establishment
of the Army at 30,000 men, but demanded
in return the recognition of Roumania as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partie
intégrale</i> of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>On August 21, Prince Charles set out on a
journey through Moldavia, accompanied by General
Prince Ghika, Mavrogheni, and his aides-de-camp.
The route ran through Buseu, Fokschani, which
was devastated by cholera, and Ajud, where the
long awaited rain first fell on the dried-up country,
then through Kaitz to Okna, where the Prince
inspected the great salt mines and the prison.
The next important halts were made at Botoschani,
an almost wholly Jewish town, and at the
Moldavian capital, Jassy, romantically situated on
the banks of the Bachlui. The town is built in
terraces on the hillside, where the numerous domes
and towers scattered amongst the green trees lend
it a most picturesque and almost oriental appearance.
The reception accorded to the Prince was
brilliant and hearty in the extreme, the only discordant
note being the refusal of the Rosnovanu
family to share in the public rejoicings. It is,
however, pleasant to note that in later years this
family sought to show by every means how completely
their opinions had changed.</p>

<p>Important and urgent news from Constantinople
then forced the Prince to bring his tour to an end,
and Cotroceni, near Bucharest, was reached on
September 7, after some 920 miles had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
traversed in seventeen days by means of about
3000 post-horses. The result of the journey was
altogether favourable, for not only had the Prince
gained a clearer insight into the affairs of Moldavia,
but the Separatist faction had been considerably
weakened by the intercourse of Prince Charles
with the leading men of the Principality.</p>

<p>The following day the Prince received the
English and French Consuls, who came to advocate
compliance with the demands of the Sublime
Porte, which, though couched in far more moderate
language, still contained the disputed clauses of
the former project. The Ministry thereupon
decided to send Ministers Stirbey and Sturdza to
Constantinople to negotiate better terms for
Roumania.</p>

<p>The Prince received a letter from his father
on September 14, 1866, containing the following
significant paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The political horizon is still very overcast; a
war with France is unavoidable, although it will
not take place this year. The 'chauvinism' of the
French Press is colossal, and the Emperor, who is
personally inclined for peace, will probably have to
give way to the pressure!..."</p></blockquote>

<p>The news from Constantinople now became more
favourable, as both General Ignatieff and the
Marquis de Moustier brought pressure to bear on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Ali Pacha in favour of Roumania. Moreover, the
condition of Crete, where an insurrection had
broken out, aided and instigated by Greece, was
in itself a reason why the Porte should come to
a definite settlement with Roumania. Negotiations,
however, suffered further delays owing to
the departure of the Marquis de Moustier and the
renewal of impossible demands by Ali Pacha, who
was now supported by England and France. The
last named believed that Prussian influence caused
the Prince's reluctance to comply with the
Emperor Napoleon's advice and proceed to Constantinople
before receiving recognition by means
of a firman, and the relations of Roumania to
France became consequently cooler. The whole
affair turned upon the words, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partie intégrale de
mon Empire</i>," which the Roumanian Ministry
refused at first to accept, but now sought to
modify by the addition of "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dans les limites fixées
par les capitulations et le Traité de Paris</i>." This
addition was at last agreed to by Ali Pacha, and
the long struggle ended on October 20. An
exchange of letters, as recommended by the
French Ambassador, then took place between
the Grand Vizier and Prince Charles, who
announced his intention of proceeding to Constantinople
to receive the firman from the hands
of the Sultan.</p>

<p>The Prince granted an audience to the Consuls
of the Powers on the following day to receive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
congratulations of their Governments upon his
recognition by the Porte before setting out on his
journey to Constantinople. At Rustchuk the
Governor of the Danubian vilayet, Midhat Pacha,
received the Prince with the utmost ceremony.
On arriving at Varna Prince Charles embarked at
once on the Imperial steam yacht <i>Issedin</i>, which
had brought Djemil Pacha and Memduh Bey to
escort him to the Golden Horn.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Constantinople the Prince
landed at Beglerby, where an imperial palace had
been destined for his reception. Thence the
Prince, in the uniform of a Roumanian general,
proceeded to Dolma Bagdsche, where the Sultan
came to the door of his cabinet to welcome him.
Next the sofa on which the Sultan was to sit a
chair was placed for the Prince, but he pushed it
gently aside, and as a Prince of Hohenzollern sat
down next to his Suzerain. The conversation which
then ensued turned first upon the Prince's journey,
and afterwards on the state of affairs in Roumania.
At the conclusion of the audience the Sultan
handed Prince Charles a paper, which he laid on
the table without looking at it, and then asked for
permission to present his suite, one of whom took
charge of the firman. The Sultan took a hearty
leave of the Prince, who then visited the Sublime
Porte, where the Grand Vizier welcomed him and
presented to him the various Turkish great dignitaries
of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>On October 26 Prince Charles received the
Ambassadors of the Powers, amongst their number
Lord Lyons, who had been of material assistance
in obtaining the recognition of the Prince, but who
was strongly opposed to any slackening of the
bonds between Turkey and the Vassal States.</p>

<p>The impression left in the Prince's mind by the
magnificent reception was that it was due more to
his descent from the House of Hohenzollern than
to the fact that he was ruler of Roumania, for the
Hospodars had been treated merely as highly
placed officials, and as a symbol of their vassaldom
were obliged to hold the Sultan's stirrup as he
mounted.</p>

<p>The second visit to the Sultan took place on
October 28, and was marked by the same heartiness
as before. Prince Charles, on leaving the
Palace, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for a review specially ordered in
his honour, passed through the Marble Gates,
which are generally opened for the Sultan
alone. The review took place in pouring rain on
the heights of Pancaldi, where six battalions, two
cavalry regiments, and four batteries were drawn
up. Ali Pacha entertained the Prince at dinner
the same evening, when Prince Charles proposed
the health of the Sultan, and expressed the wishes
he shared in common "with all Roumanians" for
the welfare of the Sultan and of the Turkish
Empire. In reply the Grand Vizier laid special
stress upon the deep interest his Imperial Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
took in the Prince and "the Moldo-Wallachian
population." Ali Pacha subsequently offered the
Prince a number of Turkish orders of the various
classes, adding that the patents would be sent to
him in blank every year, and might be granted as
the Prince thought fit. This offer was, however,
declined, and the permission of the Porte was
obtained for the institution of a medal for the
Roumanian Army. After taking leave of the
Sultan on October 30, Prince Charles returned to
Varna in the Imperial yacht <i>Issedin</i>, arriving in
Bucharest on November 2.</p>

<p>The impending elections now claimed the attention
of Prince Charles, who, in a letter to the
President of the Ministry, declared that "not even
the shadow of influence" must be brought to bear
on the electors. The Government, however, misconstrued
the expression of this wish as a concession
to the Liberal Opposition. The result of
the elections was a bitter disappointment to the
Prince and his advisers: one-third of the new
Chamber was composed of partisans of the ex-Prince
Kusa and Separatists, a second of supporters
of the Government, and the third of
Liberals. Not one of these parties, therefore,
could dispose of a decisive majority. The Chamber
was opened on November 27 by Prince Charles in
person, who adjured the Deputies to lay aside all
jealousies and personal interests, and to aid him
in reorganising the country by "accepting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
wholesome principles of honesty, industry, and
economy, which alone can raise the civilisation,
wealth, and power of the nation."</p>

<p>The failure of the crops in conjunction with
famine and cholera had added to the already heavy
financial difficulties of the country. The paper
currency was at 30 per cent. discount, whilst the
pay of the Army and the officials remained in
arrears. In spite of the applause with which the
Prince's speech was received, the Government
measures were obstructed at every turn by incessant
intrigues in the Chamber.</p>

<p>The following most interesting letter from the
Prince's father, bearing on the difficulties of
Napoleon's position, was received on December 24,
1866:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The position of France is at present most
insecure. Napoleon's dynasty must struggle with
four immense difficulties:</p>

<p>"(1) The bitter resentment of the nation at
Prussia's success in war. The Clericals do not
cease to add fuel to this smouldering fire, and it
will not be their fault if the national hatred does
not break out into open flames. The Emperor is
the most sober and reasonable of all Frenchmen,
but it is quite possible that he may allow himself
to be dragged into a war with Prussia in order
to preserve his dynasty.</p>

<p>"(2) The Roman question is one of equal importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
The withdrawal of the French force from
Rome will either lead to the instantaneous downfall
of the Papal State, which would cause an
unbounded agitation by the very strong Ultramontane
party in France against the Emperor, and
entail the most serious consequences for him, or
else the withdrawal of the troops will not lead to
the fall of the Papal State&mdash;in which case a great
bitterness would arise amongst all the Liberal
circles of France, which see the chief obstacle to
national progress in the effete government of the
Pope.</p>

<p>"Under any circumstances, the solution of this
question is dangerous for the Emperor, especially
as the Empress will materially hinder the settlement
of the situation by her Spanish temperament
and bigoted inclinations, just as she will probably
achieve her unnecessary pilgrimage to Rome in
spite of the Ministry, calculating on the domestic
weakness of the Emperor.</p>

<p>"(3) The Mexican affair is the first and most
flagrant defeat of the French Government. It is
no longer a secret that the withdrawal of the
French troops from Mexico is the result of an
earnest, even menacing pressure from North
America. If this pressure should be ignored in
Paris, the weak French force in Mexico would be
exposed to a Sicilian vesper. The troops must
therefore retire, and with them probably all
Frenchmen settled in Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is a terrible situation for the Emperor.
He destroys his own creation, the throne of
Maximilian, and so offers a most material <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">point
d'appui</i> to the powerful Opposition in France.
In other words, this is a personal defeat of the
Empire, than which none greater can be conceived!
Either a war or a disgraceful peace with North
America must follow, against which a war with
Germany, contrived in order to flatter the French
and wipe out the bad impression, will be the only
means of salvation and safety. Many millions of
French money will be lost over this business, and
the shaken and impoverished families will continue
to fan the fire of discontent. The Opposition,
which was opposed to the Mexican expedition
from the beginning, will now be justified in the
eyes of the nation, and the prestige of the Empire
will be materially injured.</p>

<p>"(4) The bad condition of the French finances
and a deficit increasing from year to year form
another great danger. The French Court itself
unfortunately does not set an example of wise
economy, and is thereby morally responsible for
the ever increasing immorality of the Administration....</p>

<p>"The Oriental question, though theoretically
dangerous, does not at first appear to be a source
of real danger. Russia, indeed, might make it so,
but England, Austria, Italy, France, and Prussia
have a too substantial interest in the <i>status quo</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
exclude the hope that several years of peace will
ensue so far as that is concerned....</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt now that Bismarck is
not only the man of the hour, but that he is also
indispensable. Prussia has become a power of the
first rank, and from henceforth must be taken into
consideration.</p>

<p>"The foreign policy of Prussia is firm, clear,
decisive, and to the point. At home various
elements of wavering and contradiction make their
influence felt.</p>

<p>"The annexed territories might already have
become more Prussian, were not the fear of
democracy so great in Berlin.... The Chambers
are willing, everything has been passed and
sanctioned that the Government demanded&mdash;but
unheard-of truths have been told, so much so that
the feudal party has not quite the courage to
glorify personal government beyond reasonable
limits.</p>

<p>"The nation has obviously matured, politically
speaking. Political extravagances have also decreased
rather than increased in the army, owing
to the consciousness of a gloriously ended war.</p>

<p>"In Southern Germany public opinion is still
continually excited, especially in Württemberg;
Bavaria sways like a reed. Prince Hohenlohe
Schillingsfürst<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> may become President of the
Ministry in place of Pfordten; his appointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
would be a sign in favour of Prussia. Baden's
attitude is the most correct; there they would
prefer the supremacy of Prussia to that of Bavaria
and Württemberg.</p>

<p>"A proof of the want of earnestness in the
unity of Southern Germany is afforded by the fact
that Bavaria is improving its Podewils rifle, Württemberg
adopts the Swiss arm, Baden the Prussian
needle gun, and the Grand Duchy of Hesse retains
the Minié! And yet everybody is complaining
of the want of unity amongst politicians and
soldiers...."</p></blockquote>

<p>In reply to a letter from Napoleon III. Prince
Charles explained the chief difficulty of the
situation thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Panslavonic party seeks to produce complications
in the East by all possible means. They
have already been able to influence Greece; the
Cretans have rebelled, and, strong in the aid of
nationalities which they cannot call upon in vain,
claim the assistance of Europe. Agitators under
Greek names are busy amongst the Christian
populations and fan their latent courage....
Emissaries endeavour to incite the population of
Moldavia, and even our Chamber of Deputies is
prepared to create difficulties for us.</p>

<p>"If the interest and sympathy of the great
Western Powers lead us to hope that the Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Question will be solved in our favour, we must
confess that we are not yet ready to obtain
advantage from the situation.... We must,
therefore, expect everything from the support of
our traditional protectors, and especially from the
friendship of your Majesty. It appears to me,
Sire, most desirable that France, England, and
Prussia should from now come to an understanding
on the matter of Eastern affairs. A close
concert between these three Powers would be
the surest guarantee of our national independence...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Prince Charles received the following autograph
letter from Queen Victoria on February 13, 1867,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</i> of his recognition by the Sultan:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">

"<span class="smcap">My dear Cousin</span>,
</p>

<p>"I cannot possibly allow the formal answer
to your letter to be despatched without adding at
the same time a few lines to the brother of my
dear and never-to-be-forgotten niece Stephanie and
my dear nephew Leopold.</p>

<p>"I also desire to offer my sincere congratulations
on the happy solution of the difficulties
with the Sultan, as well as my warmest wishes
for your future and lasting happiness and welfare.</p>

<p>"I shall always take the warmest interest in
your success, and I do not doubt that you will
continue faithful in the future to the principles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
moderation and wisdom, which you have hitherto
pursued.</p>

<p>
"I remain always your sincere cousin,</p>

<p class="sig">"VICTORIA REG."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The condition of Crete and the consequent
agitation in Greece formed the chief topic of a
letter addressed to Prince Charles by the King of
the Greeks. King George pointed out the difficulties
caused by the patriotic excitement of his
people, whose longing for war was so strong that
they expected him to fight Turkey without
money, troops, ships, or allies. He could not
appear in the streets without being greeted with
cries of "To Constantinople" from men and
women of all classes. It was the special misfortune
of his people that they thought every
insurrection must bear golden fruit, because they
themselves had always gained some end by revolution.</p>

<p>The Cretans formed three distinct Corps which
were kept supplied with ammunition and recruits
by Greek ships. This the Turkish fleet was
powerless to prevent, as it had no coal, and was
therefore forced to remain at anchor. The Greeks
reckoned confidently upon an insurrection in
Thessaly and Epirus, though, of course, they were
well aware that Russia only fomented this movement
in order that the Turkish efforts to suppress
it might indirectly strengthen the Slav element<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
by exciting sympathy in Eastern Europe. It was
at this time that the Russian Government
announced that it did not aim at the destruction
of the Ottoman Empire, but only desired emancipation
and humane treatment for the Christian
subjects of the Sultan, and that it was awaiting
a more favourable moment for the release from
the onerous conditions of the 1856 Treaty and the
re-acquisition of Bessarabia. The cession of Crete
to Greece was, however, strongly advocated by
the Russian diplomatists.</p>

<p>A ministerial crisis in Roumania was brought to
an end on March 5 by the laconic motion: "The
Chamber has no confidence in the Ministry!"
which was passed by a majority of three votes.
Eventually a new Ministry was formed under
the presidency of Cretzulesku, a moderate Conservative,
and was on the whole well received by the
Chamber.</p>

<p>A Roumanian statesman sent on a confidential
mission to Vienna by the Prince reported that the
feeling of the Austrian Government was now far
more friendly than formerly, and that the questions
of extradition and commercial treaties, consular
jurisdiction, and the appointment of an accredited
agent in Vienna would find more favourable consideration
with the Austrian statesmen.</p>

<p>A law was passed by the Chamber and promulgated
in the official <cite>Moniteur</cite> conferring
honorary citizenship on W. E. Gladstone, J. A.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Roebuck, Jules Michelet, Edgar Quinet, St. Marc
Girardin, J. E. Ubicini, and P. T. Bataillard, in
recognition of their efforts on behalf of the Balkan
States.</p>

<p>About this time Prince Charles Anthony wrote
his son an interesting letter referring to the
Luxemburg Question, which at that moment
threatened to cause a war between Prussia and
France. The Prince wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Once more we are on the threshold of great
events&mdash;it is possible that a continental war may
soon break out again, and equally possible that we
may enjoy a lasting peace. This much at least is
certain, Napoleon's star is sinking and France is
seething and fermenting."</p></blockquote>

<p>A letter from Paris aptly described the views of
the French Government on the subject of Roumania
and Prince Charles.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Prince is very popular, much loved and
highly esteemed personally, but his Government
(that of Ghika) is unpopular, wanting in initiative,
foresight, and firmness, so that its position is not
solid. Reforms make no progress, Russian intrigues
have ample play, because the indecision of
the Government and its want of energy throw
doubt on its stability. Only to-day a diplomat
remarked to me that the Russian party is getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the upper hand, that Russophile officers, such as a
certain Solomon and others, have regained their
influence and position, and that those who helped
to elect the Prince are discouraged at seeing
Russia, the eternal enemy of the country, in the
ascendant."</p></blockquote>

<p>After alluding to the project of a Russian
marriage, the letter continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Prince will soon be convinced that
Russian ambition will not give way to sentiment
or family ties. It marches straight to its goal in
spite of opposition, and yields to nothing but
superior force."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another letter from the same quarter addressed
to the Prince gives the following quaint definition
of the faults of the German character:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The German is never sympathetic to foreign
nations, he is deficient in charm, in grace. The
North German is too stiff; the South German
is too heavy ever to awaken feelings of sympathy.
This is as true as that the earth turns on its axis.
Even admitting that in diplomacy one may be
ungrateful, nevertheless the punishment seldom
fails, as witness Austria, which has paid heavily
for its ingratitude. It is most imprudent to
alienate yourself from France."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>An application for permission to return to Roumania
was received on May 26, from the exiled
Prince Kusa, who alleged that his presence was
required in a lawsuit affecting his private interests.
Though Prince Charles was inclined to grant this
favour, the decision was left to his Ministry,
who opposed the project, as they had reason to
believe that Prince Kusa's presence might provoke
troubles.</p>

<p>An unsuccessful attempt to assassinate the Czar
was made on June 7, 1867, when the Prince wrote
to congratulate his Imperial Majesty on his escape.
The Czar replied as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I thank your Highness for the sentiments
which you have expressed in your letter of
June 10, on an occasion when Divine Providence
has deigned to manifest its protection so clearly.
You are right in not doubting the affectionate interest
which I feel for you, and the warm solicitude
which I have not ceased to consecrate to the
welfare of my Christian brethren in the united
Principalities. The hopes which I entertain
regarding them are particularly founded on the
fact that a spirit of order and authority will prevail
over the passions which have excited them
only too deeply during these last days. It is for
your Highness to establish these principles firmly,
for without them no society can prosper; and I
like to believe that you will display therein a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
firmness equal to the wisdom which you have
shown since your accession to power.</p>

<p class="sig">
"ALEXANDER."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The news that Omar Pacha had at last gained
a signal victory over the Cretan insurgents was of
the greatest interest to Prince Charles, who was
well informed as to the general situation in that
quarter. Whilst the majority of the Powers had
proposed as early as April the cession of that
island to Greece, France had gone still further,
and demanded the cession of Thessaly and Epirus
as well. Austria and Russia were, however,
opposed to this, for though Russia desired to
weaken Turkey in every possible respect, it was
no part of her plan to help in strengthening
Greece. In such cases the diplomacy of the
Turkish statesmen appears to lie in the art of
giving evasive answers and in skilfully playing off
one Power against the other.</p>

<p>The recently appointed Russian Ambassador to
the Porte, General Ignatieff, made use of the
energetic demand of France on behalf of Crete to
persuade the Sublime Porte that the Western
Powers were the greatest enemies of Turkey,
whilst Russia was her only true friend and natural
ally. His influence was, however, lessened by the
Sultan's unexpected invitation to visit the Paris
Exhibition, followed by another from England.
Count Ignatieff was forced to content himself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the sarcastic reflection that, though every Court
in Europe might in turn invite the Sultan, Russia
would still have the satisfaction of seeing him
ruined financially.</p>

<p>Prince Charles proceeded to Giurgiu, on
August 5, on his way to meet the Sultan at
Rustschuk, who was returning from Paris. The
interview with his suzerain lasted about half an
hour, and Ali Pacha acted as interpreter. The
Sultan appeared in excellent spirits at the result
of his visit, and delighted with the reception he
had met with on his travels.</p>

<p>Owing to the continued hostility of France,
especially as regarded the Jewish Question,
J. Bratianu was forced to resign his portfolio, and
a day later the entire Ministry followed him.
The news of this step spread consternation
throughout the country, and threw the greatest
difficulties in the way of Stephen Golesku, who
was entrusted with the formation of the new
Ministry. The Separatists also seized upon this
critical state of affairs to reproach the Prince
openly with having sacrificed his Minister to
pressure from abroad; indeed, the whole political
situation appeared most threatening. Influential
persons in France were inciting ex-Prince Kusa
to agitate in Roumania: the Minister of Finance
wanted to resign because there were no funds for
most necessary expenses&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the officers on the
half-pay list had not received their pay for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
months; the open hostility of the Austrian and
French Press; the anti-dynastic and separatist
movement in Moldavia, fomented by Russia: all
these contributed to increase the difficulties which
beset the path of the young ruler.</p>

<p>The state of affairs in Crete remained practically
unaltered; supported by Greece and Russia, the
Cretans demanded nothing less than incorporation
with Greece, whilst England and France viewed
this proposal with disfavour. Ali Pacha, the
Grand Vizier, was sent to Crete with the most
extensive powers to pacify the island; in addition
to other reforms, a Christian Governor-General
was to be appointed. A sudden change, however,
took place in the views of the Porte, for the
Sultan at last recognised the futility of constantly
giving way to foreign interference, and determined
to hold his own by force of arms. No fewer
than 80,000 men were to be despatched to the
island, though the season was by no means
favourable to military operations.</p>

<p>In the meantime a special session of the
Roumanian Chamber was convoked on November
6 to introduce reforms in the army, to confirm
certain railway concessions, and to vote the
supplies without which the administration had
become impossible. In spite of the continued
hostility of France towards J. Bratianu, the Prince
appointed that statesman Minister of Finance.
The Chamber was then dissolved by the advice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the Ministry, who gave the following considerations
as their reasons:</p>

<p>The Chamber had been elected shortly after the
accession of the Prince, at a period when the
nation scarcely knew what policy their ruler
intended to adopt, or, indeed, the details of
the new Constitution. The consequence of this
ignorance was a wrong application of the election
laws&mdash;fully half the elections would have been
annulled had they been strictly investigated. It
was evident from the first that no Ministry could
reckon upon a majority in a House so equally
divided, and so it happened that the Budget
could not be passed at the proper time. In
February the factions had combined so far as to
defeat the Ministry, but the new majority was
again divided into three factions, and unable
therefore to do its duty. The Senate was dissolved
for the same reasons.</p>

<p>A complete victory was scored by the Liberal
Government at the general election, both in the
Chamber and the Senate. The speech from the
throne on January 15, 1868, congratulated the
Deputies on the peaceful course of the elections;
and, after touching on the Jewish Question,
insisted upon the necessity of legislating for the
army, the Church, and finance, which all demanded
their closest attention.</p>

<p>Count Bismarck pointed out to the Prince that
Russian support would be of the greatest benefit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Roumania, an opinion shared by Prince Charles
Anthony, who remarked that Russia was either a
powerful friend or a dangerous enemy. The future
of the Orient belonged to Russia in the probable
development of European affairs. "France will continue
to lose <em>prestige</em>; it is, therefore, only common
sense to step voluntarily into the Russian sphere of
influence before one is forced to do so, yet at the
same time without falling out with France...."</p>

<p>In a letter, which crossed the above, Prince
Charles wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The greatest danger for Roumania is a Franco-Russian
Alliance. The former Power at present does
its utmost to effect this. To-day France is forced to
make friends of its enemies, for nobody sides with
it. The whole Orient is against France....
Italy will have need of Prussia, and Prussia of
Italy, for they both have only evil to expect from
France.... France has lost much ground here,
and if we did not remember that she has done much
good for Roumania, we should break with her
entirely...."</p></blockquote>

<p>A Treaty&mdash;purely "platonic," as the Prince
termed it&mdash;was ratified with Servia on February 2,
1868, to "guard the reciprocal interests of the
two countries ... and to develop the prosperity
of the countries in conformity with their legitimate
and autonomous rights."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The ill-will and pique of the French Government
led to an official request for information
about the Bulgarian rebel bands, which were
reported to be assembling along the Danube preparatory
to invading Turkish territory, aided and
abetted by the Roumanian Government. These
accusations, it must be confessed, were partly
founded on fact, for it was impossible to prevent
the Roumanian nation from testifying in a practical
manner to its sympathy with its oppressed
neighbours. Besides this, many influential Bulgarian
families had sought refuge in Roumania
from the pressure of Midhat Pacha's iron hand.
The wave of hatred and enmity of the Christian
religion which at the time appeared to sweep
over the whole Turkish Empire contributed materially
to incite the Bulgarians in Roumania to
undertake reprisals in revenge of the outrages
inflicted upon their native country.</p>

<p>The following letter from Count Bismarck was
received by Prince Charles:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, <i>27th February, 1868</i>.
</p>

<p>"I had the honour to receive your Highness's
gracious letter of the 27th inst., and make use to-day
of the first secure opportunity of tendering
your Highness my humble thanks for the gracious
sentiments expressed therein. It will always be
a pleasant duty, and the outcome of my personal
attachment, to be of service to your Highness's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
interests here. I have endeavoured to show my
devotion in the latest phase of politics by maintaining
in London and Paris my conviction that
the rumours about the warlike undertakings on
your Highness's territory are malicious inventions.
The origin of these reports appears to be a Belgian
Consul, whom we had cause to complain of in
Brussels. At the same time, it must be remembered
that the rumours have been used in Paris
to make your Highness feel that an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</i> with
Russia does not accord with the intentions of
France. This does not affect the fact that every
stable Government of Roumania has need of
friendly relations with Russia as much and,
indeed, owing to its geographical situation, even
more than with any other of the European
Powers. Your Highness must expect the reaction
which will result from pursuing your own course.
I do not doubt that the mission to St. Petersburg
will result the more favourably, as the Bishop of
Ismail succeeds in enlisting the active sympathy
of his brethren and fellow priests in Petersburg,
and in publicly fostering the impression that this
has happened....</p>

<p class="sig">
"v. BISMARCK."
</p></blockquote>

<p>As foretold by Bismarck, the mission to St.
Petersburg caused the Paris Government to look
upon Roumania as lost to France. Bratianu was
accused of having thrown himself into the arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of Russia, backed by his large majority at the
recent elections. Again and again the young
Prince was warned not to offend the French
Emperor by base ingratitude.</p>

<p>Prince Charles Anthony wrote to his son that
"Bismarck's ... observation that Roumania is the
Belgium of South-Eastern Europe is perfectly correct.
Roumania, like Belgium, must not attempt
foreign politics, but must live on the best possible
terms with her neighbours: she will then share in
the fruits which in due season will fall from the
tree of Europe. But she must not pluck them
herself, especially while they are unripe.... The
situation of the Jews, such as prevails on the Lower
Danube, is an evil rash upon the body of the
State; but it is as impossible to solve this
Jewish Question with one blow as to drive a
rash away at once. However, I have complete
confidence in your ability to use the right means.
The same applies to the dreaded declaration of
independence. Such a one-sided action would be
the most colossal imprudence: the force of circumstances
and not the wish of the Roumanian
nation will be the operative factor." This sage
counsel prevailed, although the declaration of
independence was strongly advocated by many of
the Prince's advisers.</p>

<p>In June 1868 the arrival of Prince Napoleon
on a visit to the Prince of Roumania was heartily
welcomed by the whole nation, which was glad of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
an opportunity of expressing her sympathy and
regard for France and the Imperial dynasty.
Prince Napoleon, however, created a very indifferent
impression, for not even the utmost
enthusiasm, the deafening cheers, the showers of
bouquets from the hands of fair ladies, were able
to move him from the passive and icy demeanour
which he displayed on his arrival. Although he
had barely one word to say to the many persons
presented to him, his manner to Prince Charles
was very amiable, and he frequently repeated his
offer of assistance to the Prince. The conversation
did not take a political turn, with the
exception of the one sentence: "Paris considers
you wholly in the Russian camp."</p>

<p>The greatest confusion still prevailed in Crete,
where the inhabitants persisted in their demand
for union with Greece, and even elected sixteen
Deputies to represent the island in the Athenian
Chamber. This step, however, created a great
difficulty for the Greek Government, for if these
Cretan Deputies were allowed to sit, the censure of
the European Powers would be incurred, whilst if
they were sent about their business the excitement
of the populace might easily precipitate a crisis.</p>

<p>The news of the assassination of Prince Michael
of Servia, who had always preserved the most
friendly relations with Prince Charles, was received
on June 11, 1868, with consternation and sincere
regret by the Roumanian nation. Prince Milan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Obrenowitch was unanimously elected Prince of
Servia, under a regency composed of MM. Blagnavatz,
Ristitch, and Gavrilovitch, by the Skuptchina
on July 5, 1868.</p>

<p>A band of one hundred and fifty Bulgarians
assembled in Roumanian territory and crossed the
Danube on July 16 near Petroschani, abetted by
a farmer, who concealed their rifles on an island in
midstream. Aided by the Bulgarians south of
the river, the insurrection spread rapidly, until
Midhat Pacha defeated the rebels at Letzwitza.
A proclamation of the provisional government of
the Balkans was found among them, calling the
Bulgarians to shake off the Turkish yoke and
found a Bulgarian kingdom. With barbarous
severity Midhat Pacha thereupon ordered all
prisoners to be executed in their native villages
as a deterrent to the remainder of the population.
The Roumanian Government was accused of
fomenting the insurrection, or at least of having
taken no steps to prevent the congregation of
insurgents on Roumanian territory; but the real
culprits were proved to have been Russian
instigators. Prince Charles refers to the incident
as follows, in a letter to his father:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The insurrection appears to be wholly suppressed
for the present, and the few insurgents
still remaining in Bulgaria have retired to the
Balkans. How long the peace will remain undisturbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I cannot say; but the fact remains that
the bitter feeling of the Bulgarians has reached
its climax, and can only be compared to religious
fanaticism. Numerous bands of insurgents are
still on Roumanian territory, but we are forcing
them to disperse. Much anxiety is caused by
guarding our extended frontier."... "Public
works have now come to the front: a law has
been formulated and passed by the Chamber that
each Roumanian shall work three days or pay
for three days' labour in the year on the roads of
the country. This measure was at first opposed,
as it was considered a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corvée</i>, but we succeeded in
refuting this argument.... I fully realise your
advice, that my chief aim must be directed to
the development of the material interests of the
country. I should prefer to leave politics severely
alone, and cut myself off from the rest of the
world for some time to come, but the foreign
Powers will not permit it. France in particular is
attempting to throw difficulties in my way; the
Marquis de Moustier desires at all costs to fix
some quarrel on Roumania and to turn out my
Ministry, which no longer inspires confidence in
<em>France</em>; for this I am sorry; but, nevertheless, it
will not induce me to dismiss a Ministry which
possesses <em>my</em> entire confidence. I forgot to
mention that Bourée, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</i> of the Bulgarian
incident, expressed the opinion: 'This circumstance
must be utilised to demand the fall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the Roumanian Ministry.' I think it more
important to change the Ministers in France than
in Roumania&mdash;the events in Paris, in the Sorbonne,
the Rochefort trial in consequence of the
violent article in the <cite>Lanterne</cite>, &amp;c., are ominous
portents. The Second Empire is severely shaken,
and can only be maintained by radical means if
the fatal sentence '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il est trop tard</i>' is not
to come true&mdash;as I am inclined to believe it
will be. Sympathy with France has disappeared
in the East, and she has only herself to thank
if the Christian nations throw themselves into
the arms of Russia. Turkish and French politics
are identical here....</p>

<p>"Many irregularities and embezzlements still
occur in the various branches of the administration,
but by no means in the same degree as
formerly; a considerable period will probably
elapse before this evil can be wholly remedied....
The juries are not always capable of fulfilling
their task; they often sentence those who
have been guilty of minor offences and acquit
notorious criminals.... I am against Press prosecutions
in Roumania, for what the papers write is
valueless; I am in favour of unlimited freedom of
the Press; it is decidedly less dangerous than
limited freedom, the consequences of which are
visible in France to-day."</p></blockquote>

<p>Events in Spain now appeared to be reaching a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
critical period, as Marshal Prim and Serrano were
engaged in the task of selecting a ruler for the
vacant throne. Rumour pointed to the following
as possible candidates: The King of Portugal, the
Hereditary Prince of Hohenzollern, Prince Philip
of Coburg, and the Duc de Montpensier.</p>

<p>In a letter to the Crown Prince of Prussia,
thanking him for a communication received
through Colonel von Krenski,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Prince Charles
remarked:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The revolution in Spain came very much <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à
propos</i>, for France will now be forced to keep
quiet. As an old acquaintance I deplore the fate
of the poor Queen, but honestly confess it was no
more than was to be expected. I should like to
see an Orleans or Philip of Coburg ascend the
Spanish throne, but on no account a regent put
forward by Napoleon! If the Republic is victorious
in Spain it will soon break out in France,
and at the present time this would be a lesser
danger for the development of Germany than the
Napoleonic dynasty."</p></blockquote>

<p>The repeated attacks of Austria, or rather of
Count Beust, on the Golesku Ministry and on
Bratianu in particular, proved that the retention
of the latter might lead to the most serious consequences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
The nature of these attacks may be
recognised from the misstatements in the Austrian
Red Book, which estimated the number of needle-guns
sold to Prince Charles at 50,000 instead
of 10,000, whilst Roumania was termed an
"arsenal" by Count Beust. Shortly after the
opening of the Chamber the Ministry resigned,
and Prince D. Ghika was entrusted with the
formation of a new Ministry. The most prominent
member was M. Cogalniceanu, and the Ministry
was composed of statesmen belonging to every
political party. In a letter to the President
Prince Charles praised his programme as truly
national, and expressed the hope that he would
succeed in effacing all differences of opinion and
those intrigues so prejudicial to the interests of
the State.</p>

<p>On December 9, 1868, the following letter was
received from Prince Charles Anthony:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The candidature for the Spanish throne has
hitherto been discussed only in newspapers; we
have not ourselves heard a single word about it,
and even should this project be placed more
closely before us, I should never counsel the
acceptance of this hazardous though dazzling position.
Moreover, France would never be able to
consent to the establishment of a Hohenzollern on
the other side of the Pyrenees on account of our
relations with Prussia; nay, it is already swollen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
with jealousy because a member of that house
rules the Lower Danube....</p>

<p>"Bismarck appears to me just now to possess
rather less influence in Home questions.... In
the Foreign Office, however, he continues undisturbed,
although even there he has often to bow
to the views of the King."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a subsequent letter to his son congratulating
him on the excellent results of the change in the
Ministry, Prince Charles Anthony wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"England, which now possesses a new Ministry,
must be managed with tact, for the independence
of the Porte is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corde sensible</i> of both Tories
and Whigs. If England is convinced that
Roumania does not wish to emancipate herself, you
will be able to reckon with confidence on England's
sympathy and friendship for Roumania."</p></blockquote>

<p>Since Greece on December 18 declined to accept
the Turkish ultimatum, all Greek subjects living
in Turkey were informed that they would have to
leave the country in fourteen days' time, and a
Conference assembled in Paris for the purpose of
adjusting the differences of these two nations and
preventing a war. Their efforts were crowned
with success, for Greece accepted the declaration
of the Conference on February 6, 1869.</p>

<p>Count Andrassy, the Hungarian statesman,
endeavoured to convince the Roumanian Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that its chief source of danger lay in Russia
and that the interests of the Austro-Hungarian
Monarchy were centred in a strong Roumania,
which would be able to oppose a barrier to the
Panslavonic element. After offering his services
in the way of smoothing over the difficulties
which had arisen between the two States, Count
Andrassy expressed the opinion that the best
solution of the Eastern Question would be a Confederation
of the Eastern nations and the creation
of various independent States, "to make the West
understand that the question could be solved
without the influence and beyond the aspirations
of Russia."</p>

<p>In reply to a letter of Prince Charles regarding
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</i> with Hungary, Prince
Bismarck wrote on February 2, 1869, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I consider it a very fortunate and cleverly
managed turn of events that your Highness's relations
to the Porte should have improved. I am convinced
that if the Porte believes that it has nothing
to fear for its possessions from the Roumanian
Government, it will be a more useful and perhaps
a more sincere friend to your Highness than the
majority of the European Powers, who can hardly
interfere with your Highness so long as you are
on good terms with the Porte. Turkey has much
less to fear from a strong government in Roumania
which maintains peace and quiet&mdash;than from a weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and revolutionary state of affairs in the Principalities.
I therefore consider, if your Highness
will graciously permit me to give expression to my
long and active political experience, that the first
requirement of your Highness's policy is the establishment
of your authority in the interior, and the
maintenance of confidential relations with the
Porte. The means by which such relations can be
promoted by personal intercourse with influential
men in Constantinople will doubtless be known to
your Highness's agents there. The maintenance
of your Highness's authority at home rests principally
upon the maintenance of an absolutely
reliable force of a couple of thousand men able to
enforce obedience wherever they are assembled.
The result of such obedience will then render
possible a regular administration and a certain
execution of the law. If your Highness achieves
this result, the glory and practical success of your
Government will be greater and more lasting than
any extension of the Roumanian rule in the East
could make it. The ideal for Roumania appears
to me to be the title <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de la Belgique des bouches
du Danube</i>, and for your Highness the glory and
the gratitude of Europe such as King Leopold
left behind him. The Roumanians, as we judge
them from this distance, are neither essentially
warlike nor ambitious to rule other nations....</p>

<p>"If this conception meets with your Highness's
approval, amicable relations with Hungary would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
arise spontaneously. I by no means advocate the
cooling of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</i> with Russia; nor need it
suffer through Roumania's friendly feeling for
Hungary, if your Highness only succeeds in cultivating
relations with the Czar and Chancellor in
St. Petersburg, without employing the channel
of excited and exciting consular agents. The
Imperial Government itself is far more liberal and
moderate than its agents in the East....</p>

<p>"The present demands of all nations and most
of the Governments of Europe are secure conditions
of peace, and everything that your Highness
may do to maintain these, if you announce at
the same time that it is done for the sake of peace,
will receive the applause of Europe, though at
first the hired papers of the intriguers for war may
decry your action. But if your Highness believes
that there is no power to render innocuous those
who for foreign money endanger the peace and the
stability of your Highness's rule, I cannot divine
the motives which persuade a scion of so illustrious
a house as that of your Highness to persevere in
so ungrateful a task...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Prince Charles described the motives which led
to the dissolution of the Chamber as follows to
his father:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The conflict between the Chamber and the
Ministry&mdash;sought by the former in the appointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of General Macedonski to the command of
the Bucharest Division&mdash;shows clearly how the
Chamber endeavoured to prevent the consolidation
of the present Ministry in the hope of undermining
all authority. I considered this a great danger,
and the greater the danger, the more rapidly and
energetically must one intervene. Europe desires
peace; and it is not for us, a little State, which has
such an endless labour of development yet before it,
and so much to do before it can become strong&mdash;it
is not for us to seek and agitate for war. I hope
that in the next Chamber the quiet and reasonable
element of the country will be represented, for
this alone can ensure its future. The election
struggles will, however, be hotly contested, as the
opposition will employ every means to victory.
Two days before the dissolution of the Chamber I
had a five hours' conversation with Bratianu....
He thought that the situation at home was most
serious, and that a catastrophe was imminent. I
replied that I feared nothing. '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un Hohenzollern
ne se laisse pas si facilement renverser comme un
prince parvenu.</i>'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Amongst other rumours, that of an intended abdication
gained much credence at this time, whilst
several letters were received threatening assassination.
Prince Charles declined to pay the least heed
to these menaces, and to show his confidence in his
adopted country rode long distances daily in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
directions. It was only natural that Prince Charles
Anthony's paternal anxiety should be aroused by
the gloomy picture of the affairs of Roumania and
their effect on the Prince's health. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have seen Krenski and learnt from him
much that is new and interesting, but find that
he regards matters in too gloomy a light and
views everything with ultra-Prussian eyes. It is
a real calamity that the Prussians, despite their
qualities of spirit, character, and knowledge, are
frequently deficient in objective conception and
judgment!</p>

<p>"Krenski draws a gloomy picture of your
situation, and I had to restrain him from painting
the matter too darkly to your dear mother. You
were looking ill, had no appetite, little sleep, and
your exhaustion was patent to every one!...</p>

<p>"I consider it absolutely necessary that you
should come here as arranged in April. It is of
the utmost importance for two reasons: first of
all, it will give the lie to the current reports that
you dare not leave the country for a moment
owing to imminent dangers. It is politically most
important that it should be seen that you can
safely venture, in spite of all, to be absent for a
short time. Secondly, you will never be able to
think of marriage unless you take steps personally
in the matter....</p>

<p>"There is no news at all. I do not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
whether I shall be able to go to Berlin for the
birthday. My foot is better, but it is not completely
cured, and the greatest caution is necessary.
It is depressing for me to feel myself an invalid
when otherwise in perfect health.</p>

<p>"After a spring-like winter we are now having
a winter-like spring. It is to be hoped that
April will bring us the inexpressible happiness of
a reunion with you!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Prince Charles replied to this letter as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I hope you are not angry because I have not
complied with your urgent invitation to come to
Germany. I do not think it can be necessary to
assure you how much my heart draws me to my
deeply loved parents, my dearest possessions on
earth. But he who assumes so great a responsibility
as I have must not be ruled by his heart, but by
his head. I fear Krenski has described the situation
here in too gloomy a light&mdash;it is not so serious
as he thinks. With patience, endurance, and
energy everything can be attained, and I am
convinced that I shall reach my appointed goal.
It is true that during the time Krenski was here
I had an enormous amount of work, little peace,
and much annoyance. This, however, did not
discourage me for a moment, whilst Krenski, who
has much too soft a heart for a man and a soldier,
often despaired. It was only natural that I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
have no appetite or sleep, as the many wearisome
tasks, without any distraction, exhausted and
excited me. At present I am in excellent health,
and await the result of the elections with calmness
and less excitement than my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entourage</i>, for I
know what I have to do, if it should come to a
serious conflict. Most decidedly I shall not draw
the shorter lot...."</p></blockquote>

<p>The news of the death of the former Hospodar
of Wallachia, Barbu Stirbey, was received from
Nice in April 1869. Only a few weeks before
he had written to the Prince, thanking him for
some photographs of his native country. "God
will bless the labours of your Highness and will
grant you the glory of being the founder of a
new Roumania. Nobody knows better than I
the difficulties in the path of a Roumanian Prince
who endeavours to attain what is right; they
will not discourage your Highness, though they
may defer the realisation of your hopes. To
conquer all these difficulties at once would be
impossible...."</p>

<p>Prince Charles spent his thirtieth birthday
(April 20, 1869) on a tour in Moldavia, where he
inspected the progress of the railways. Thanks
to the initiative of the Prince, the great bridge
over the Buseu, 550 yards long, had been completed,
and communication between the two great provinces
was no longer exposed to interruption by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
bad weather or floods. No less than five bridges
in all had been constructed for the line to Fokschani,
and it was with the greatest pleasure that the
Prince noticed the expression of the gratitude of
Moldavia in the inscription on the triumphal arch
at Bakau: "Welcome to the founder of the
Roumanian railways."</p>

<p>A report from Paris informed the Prince that
an intrigue was on foot there to instigate a
revolution in Bucharest, and that this project was
also known at Vienna. A suitable pretender had
been sought for in the Roumanian capital, ever
since the recall of the French military mission, and
a son of a former Hospodar was now said to have
been selected to replace Prince Charles. The
alleged reason for this Parisian intrigue was the
complaint that since Bratianu's resignation Prussia
practically ruled the Principality through the
North German Consul-General.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with the greatest joy that
Prince Charles turned from these sordid affairs
and devoted himself for a time to his elder
brother Leopold. After a separation of a long and
anxious three years the brothers met on April 27,
shortly before Easter, at the capital of Moldavia,
Jassy. Prince Leopold was thus able to witness
a striking episode, which occurred as the venerable
Metropolitan quitted the Church on Easter morning
to announce, in accordance with traditional custom,
to all the world: "Christ is risen." At the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
moment Prince Charles stepped forward on the
daïs, before which some thirty convicts in chains
stood waiting the clemency of the Sovereign, and
ordered their fetters to be struck off to commemorate
the holy hour. It was an affecting
moment! The clatter of the falling chains
imparted a bitter-sweet tone of gladness and
sorrow amidst the universal rejoicings of the
great festival of the Eastern Church.</p>

<p>The visit of the Hereditary Prince was, however,
spoilt by the terrible downpour of rain, which
prevented most of the festivities in his honour.
Many of the smaller bridges were carried away by
the floods, and on one occasion the Hohenzollern
Princes were in imminent danger of being swept
away by a mountain torrent. Prince Otto<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of
Bavaria passed through Bucharest on his way to
Constantinople; but, strangely enough, his arrival
was announced through the Consul-General of
Austria and not by the North German Consul.
At a dinner given in his honour the Prince displayed
great amiability, but Prince Charles noticed
with regret the great melancholy with which
Prince Otto's mind appeared to be surrounded.</p>

<p>Prince Leopold, accompanied by his brother, set
out on his homeward journey on June 7, and
visited Kalafat, Turnu Severin, and Orsowa,
where a monument had been erected to commemorate
the recovery of the stolen crown of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Hungary. After taking an affectionate farewell of
his brother, Prince Charles returned, lonely and
rather downcast, to his work in Bucharest.</p>

<p>Prince Ypsilanti, the Greek Ambassador at
Paris, awaited the return of the Prince to lay
before him the draft of a treaty between
Roumania and Greece. The proposals aimed at
nothing less than the "complete independence of
Roumania and the Greek provinces of Turkey"
by means of a combined action of the two rulers,
which was to take place six months after the
necessary arrangements had been settled. The
numbers to be employed, and the support of an
insurrection in Bulgaria were also touched upon.</p>

<p>Prince Charles, however, adopted the same
reserved attitude towards these startling proposals
as he had done on a previous occasion, when Prince
Ypsilanti, as early as May, brought a letter from
the King of Greece thanking Prince Charles for his
sympathy in the late crisis, and excusing the delay
in replying.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I have not hesitated to comply with the
decision of the Paris Conference on being confronted
by the alternative, due to the ill-will of
Europe towards the heroic struggle in Crete, of
either allowing the insurrection to extend in that
island without any practical result, or of commencing
a war with Turkey, which was fraught
with disadvantageous conditions for Greece."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
This bitter decision would not have been in vain
if it sufficed to prove to the Christian nations of
the East that they must first be strong enough
to achieve their rights by force before they could
attempt to throw off the Turkish yoke.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Prince Charles's reply ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You cannot doubt, Sire, that I share with all
my heart the sentiments expressed in your letter,
and sympathise with the painful impressions
which you recall. The community of interests in
politics and religion between Greece and Roumania,
as well as the identity of their commercial
interests in so many points, naturally imposes
upon us the duty of endeavouring zealously on
both sides to strengthen the bonds which already
unite the two nations. This tendency will respond
to my dearest wishes."</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>MARRIAGE AND HOME LIFE</h3>


<p class="noind">Early in the summer of 1869 Prince Charles
received a very cordial invitation to visit the Czar
at Livadia in the Crimea. This mark of regard
was the more welcome as a project was on foot in
St. Petersburg for the abolition of consular jurisdiction
in Roumania, a measure which Prince
Charles was most eager to see adopted. In
writing to his father he gratefully referred to this
topic: "Russia has very wisely taken the
initiative in this most important question, which
will be unwelcome to France; but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant mieux</i>, for
the French Cabinet is still very conservative, as it
wishes to keep in with Turkey. But why should
it agree with Turkey only about Roumania and
not about Egypt? Why does it side <em>with</em>
England in Roumania, and oppose England <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à
couteau tiré</i> in Egypt? This policy, in one word,
is based upon interest&mdash;material interest. It is,
therefore, only politic to endeavour to attract
French capital for our great undertakings: I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
already discussed this idea with several people.
England is, on the whole, neutral to Roumania,
and we have nothing to expect from that quarter.
Its Eastern policy is by no means favourable to
the Christian nations."</p>

<p>The Ministry were empowered by a decree,
signed on August 9, to act as regents during the
first absence of Prince Charles from Roumania,
and the Prince set out for the Crimea on August 14.
After a smooth sea passage Odessa was reached on
the 16th, and the Prince continued his journey to
Sebastopol the following day on board the imperial
yacht <i>Kasbek</i>. The aspect of this once prosperous
port was melancholy in the extreme, and it almost
seemed as if time had stood still since the date of
the terrible siege. All the large buildings near
the harbour, such as barracks and warehouses,
remained in the state in which the British and
French shells had left them. In riding round the
south front of the fortress the Prince easily recognised
the approaches and parallels of the Allies:
the Malakhoff Tower had been so effectually bombarded
that it was difficult to believe how strong
a work it had once been; the Redan, on the other
hand, which had cost England so many lives, was
in comparatively good condition.</p>

<p>Continuing his journey by carriage the next
morning, Prince Charles reached Livadia at five
in the afternoon after a long and fatiguing drive.
The Czar received him with the greatest cordiality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and remarked at once that the courteous
attitude of the Prince was enough to attract the
animosity of the whole of Europe. The conversation
then turned upon the affairs of Roumania,
about which the Czar showed himself well informed
on every point. Prince Charles was then presented
to the Czarina, a cousin of his mother, to the
Grand Duchess Marie, and later on to the Czarevitch
and his wife, as well as to the Grand Duke
Alexis. Unfortunately the tropical heat affected
both the Czar and his guest to no slight degree,
and the pleasure of the meeting was thus materially
discounted. As early as August 22 Prince Charles
was forced to bid his hospitable hosts good-bye,
that he might attend the Roumanian manœuvres
before his visit to his parents in Germany.</p>

<p>The fears, which had been openly expressed, for
the safety of Roumania during the Prince's absence
proved to have been utterly unfounded, for, though
the papers, the <cite>Romanul</cite> and the <cite>Trajan</cite>, emulated
each other in their attacks upon the dynasty, their
revolutionary efforts met with no response at all,
and it was therefore with a light heart that Prince
Charles set out on September 7 to rejoin his dearly
loved parents in South Germany. Before he
quitted the territory of Roumania an amnesty was
granted for all political and Press offences, in
order to show the Prince's confidence that no
intrigue was able to shake his hold upon the hearts
of his people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The journey to the West, which was to exert
so potent an influence on the Prince's life, was
broken first at Vienna, where the Emperor of
Austria had announced his intention of receiving
the Roumanian Prince. For the first time since the
war of 1866 the Emperor wore the ribbon of the
Black Eagle, as a compliment to the house of
Hohenzollern. Prince Charles seized the opportunity
of assuring his Majesty that it would
always be the policy of Roumania to stand on the
best terms with Austria. Count Beust, who ventured
to remark that the cost of the Roumanian
Army was out of all proportion to its Budget,
received the apt retort that the arsenals were
unfortunately empty, a reference to the Count's
statement that "Roumania was simply a large
arsenal." The reception accorded to the Prince
was so hearty that the Viennese Press expressed
the opinion that Prince Charles would later on
have to answer to the Porte for his assumption of
sovereign bearing.</p>

<p>After a short stay in Munich, where he met
Prince Hohenlohe Schillingfürst [the present
German Chancellor], Prince Charles rejoined his
parents on September 16, after a separation of
more than three years. The peace and quiet of
home life, however, was interrupted the very next
day by the arrival of a delegate of the Spanish
Cortes, Don Eusebio di Salazar, who came to offer
the Hereditary Prince the Crown of Spain. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
idea was by no means new, for several papers
had, in October 1868, mentioned the Prince
Leopold as a likely candidate on the ground that
he was not only a Catholic and the son-in-law of
the King of Portugal, but the very opposite of
his "amiable brother, the Roumanian Prince
Carol, by the Grace of Bratianu." There was no
lack of candidates for the vacant throne. Napoleon
favoured the aspirations of the Prince of Asturia,
the Empress Eugénie those of Don Carlos, and
the Spanish Ambassador in Paris those of the
Duke of Genoa. Don Salazar mentioned that the
eyes of the Spanish nation had first turned
towards Prince Charles, who had shown such
courage and talent in a similar position. The
Hereditary Prince declared that he would only
consider the offer if he was elected unanimously
and without rivals.</p>

<p>On September 28 Prince Charles left the Weinburg
for Baden, where he was to meet the Prussian
Royal Family. The Crown Prince urged him to
lay aside all other views, and to seek the hand
of Princess Elisabeth of Wied, whom he knew
intimately, as one who would bring the same
devotion to the duties of her position as the
Prince himself. He concluded by offering to
arrange a meeting, as if by chance, at Darmstadt
on the 13th, to which proposal Prince Charles at
once assented.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Prince paid a promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
visit to the French Emperor, whom he found
much altered in personal appearance since the last
time he had seen him in 1863. Napoleon
received him with great cordiality and presented
him with the Grand Cross of the Legion of
Honour. Prince Charles was commissioned to
inform King William of the peaceful intentions of
France, and of the Emperor's sincere wish to
remain on the best terms with Prussia. Napoleon
declared that no one could understand the difficulties
of Prince Charles's position better than he,
for to rule a Latin race was no easy matter. On
hearing of the projected marriage, Napoleon
expressed his satisfaction, and added with emphasis:
"The German princesses are so well
brought up!"</p>

<p>As the interview with Princess Elisabeth was
to take place at Cologne instead of Darmstadt,
Prince Charles set out for the former city on
October 12. The meeting took place at the <em>Flora</em>,
where the Dowager Princess of Wied was dining
with her daughter before proceeding to Madame
Schumann's concert. Prince Charles and Princess
Elisabeth, who had already met once or twice
before in Berlin society, walked a little ahead of
the remainder of the party, talking over old times
in Berlin. Before the promenade came to an end,
Prince Charles had fallen sincerely in love with
Princess Elisabeth, and was resolved to risk all,
and to ask for her hand. A private interview with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
her mother the Princess of Wied was arranged,
and resulted in the Princess consenting to ascertain
her daughter's wishes. After a long quarter
of an hour the answer "Yes" was brought to the
Prince, who at once hastened to receive the reply
from the lips of the young Princess herself. Affairs
of State of an urgent nature, however, prevented
the Prince from obeying the dictates of his heart
and remaining in the company of his betrothed.</p>

<p>After an absence of forty-eight hours Prince
Charles returned from Paris to Neuwied, where the
betrothal was celebrated on October 15, 1869. An
enormous number of congratulatory telegrams
were received by the young couple, including
messages from the King and Crown Prince of
Prussia and the Emperor Napoleon. The general
impression created by Prince Charles's choice was
extremely favourable, as an alliance with a reigning
House would have evoked much jealousy and
intrigue. As the marriage was purely one of
inclination this danger was avoided; and the
political neutrality of Roumania was by no means
affected.</p>

<p>Affairs of State demanded the speedy return of
the Prince to the land of his adoption, and the
wedding-day was fixed for November 15. A
numerous and distinguished company, including
the Queen of Prussia, accompanied by the Grand
Duchess of Baden, attended the ceremony at
Neuwied, which was first celebrated in the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Catholic Chapel and afterwards according to the
rites of the Protestant Church. The text of the
sermon was aptly chosen, as alluding to the
difficulties and troubles which were to be
encountered in the far-off Eastern country:
"Whither thou goest, I will go: and where thou
lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my
people, and thy God my God."</p>

<p>Only a few days remained before the stern call
of duty summoned the happy pair to their life-work
in Roumania. The journey to the Princess's
new home in Bucharest was commenced on
November 18. After a short stay in Vienna the
travellers reached Roumanian territory on the
22nd. Every town through which they passed was
profusely decorated, and the enthusiasm of the
Roumanian nation appeared to surpass even that
with which they had welcomed Prince Charles on
his accession. A hundred and one guns announced
the arrival of the Prince and Princess in Bucharest,
and the town had put on all its finery in honour
of the occasion. After a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> had been
celebrated by the venerable Metropolitan Niphon,
fifty happy couples who had been married at the
cost of the State defiled past their Highnesses.</p>

<p>The following day deputations from all parts of
the country were received in the throne-room,
when the Princess wore for the first time the
diamond coronet presented by the people of
Bucharest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Princess Elisabeth at once commenced to take
an active share in her husband's labours, and
visited with him the various charitable and
educational establishments in the capital. The
innate generosity and liberality of the Prince had,
however, made such inroads upon his purse, that
many of their cherished designs had to be
abandoned for the time being for lack of funds.
At this moment, however, the most prominent
members of the Chamber were on the point of
introducing a measure granting the Princess a
yearly sum of £12,000, but Prince Charles declined
to accept this offer until the financial situation of
Roumania had improved. The Opposition at once
seized the opportunity of representing such a
proposal as a "robbery," and their organs vied
with each other in the most violent and unworthy
attacks on the Prince and Princess. Some even
lowered themselves so far as to send the grossest
of these attacks to the Princess in registered
letters! The violent scenes and the obstruction
in the Chamber left the Budget unvoted, and
again placed the Ministry in a most unenviable
position, from which they were only released by
their resignation in February 1870.</p>

<p>The new Ministry under A. Golesku displayed
its weakness from the day of its formation. The
Opposition openly used threats such as: "This
dynasty cannot be endured," "Golesku will be
the last of Prince Charles's Ministers," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
declared that a "bloody tragedy" would shortly
be enacted in the streets of the capital. A far-spreading
conspiracy against the peace of the
country made itself the more felt, since there were
no police worthy of the name; the National Guard
also was a source of real danger, whilst the apathy
of the Ministry permitted these evils to flourish
unchecked.</p>

<p>The question of the Spanish throne appeared to
have been satisfactorily dismissed, to judge from a
letter from Count Bismarck: "The political
horizon, seen from Berlin, appears at present so
unclouded that there is nothing of interest to
report, and I only hope that no unexpected event
will render the lately arisen hope of universal
peace questionable." Eight days later, on March 1,
Prince Charles received the news that Don Salazar
had been despatched to Berlin to urge once more
upon Prince Leopold the acceptance of the Spanish
crown, but both he and his father felt disinclined
to accept this offer, unless it was considered
absolutely necessary to the interests of the
Prussian State. Bismarck, on the other hand,
warmly supported the offer of the Spanish
Regency, and pointed out to the King the benefits
which must ensue if an allied country lay upon
the other side of France. The commerce of
Germany would also receive a great impetus if
the resources of Spain, with its enormous sea-board,
were developed under a Hohenzollern. King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
William, however, did not agree with his
Minister's opinion, and left the decision entirely
in the hands of Prince Leopold, whose chief objection
appeared to be the number of pretenders to
the throne. The Crown Prince of Prussia had
also warned him that, though the Government
might support him at first, it was by no means
certain that this support would be continued afterwards!
On March 16 Prince Leopold informed
the King that he felt compelled to decline the
offer; but, as Bismarck still insisted upon the
throne being accepted by a Hohenzollern, his
younger brother, Prince Frederick, was recalled
from Italy by telegram to take the place of his
brother. The young Prince, however, also refused
to accept the offered crown unless ordered to do
so by the King. Nevertheless, in spite of opposition,
the Chancellor persisted in declaring that
the necessities of politics demanded that a Hohenzollern
Prince should accede to the wish of the
Spanish Regency.</p>


<p class="center">"<i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>March 20, 1870</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I have been here [Berlin] for a fortnight on
most important family business: nothing less was
on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tapis</i> than the acceptance or refusal of the
Spanish crown by Leopold, which was offered
officially by the Spanish Government, though
under the seal of a European State secret.</p>

<p>"This question preoccupies everybody here. Bismarck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
wishes it to be accepted for dynastic
and political reasons; whilst the King asks
whether Leopold will willingly accept the summons.
A very interesting and important council
took place on the 15th, under the presidency of
the King, the Crown Prince, ourselves, Bismarck,
Roon, Moltke, Schleinitz, Thile, and Delbrück
being present. The unanimous decision of the
councillors was in favour of acceptance, as fulfilling
a Prussian patriotic duty. For many reasons
Leopold, after a long struggle, declined. But
since Spain desires <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avant tout</i> a Catholic Hohenzollern,
I have proposed Fritz in the event of his
consenting. He is at present between Nice and
Paris, but has not been reached or found by
telegraph. We hope, however, to communicate
with him shortly, and I hope that he will then
allow himself to be persuaded.</p>

<p>"But all this is in the future and the secret
must be preserved for the present...."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Prince Charles Anthony informed his son of the
course of events in a letter dated from Berlin,
April 22:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Spanish Question has again brought me
here; it is now approaching its decisive stage.
After Leopold refused the offer for weighty
reasons, the candidature of Fritz was seriously
taken in hand. An immediate settlement was
necessary, as pressure was brought to bear from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Madrid; your brother, however, most decidedly
declared that he could not undertake the task!
The matter must therefore be allowed to drop,
and an historical opportunity has thus been lost
for the house of Hohenzollern, an incident which
has never occurred before and which probably will
never occur again.... If the King had given the
<em>order</em> at the last hour, Fritz would have obeyed;
but as he was left free to decide, he resolved not
to undertake the task.... The Spanish secret
has been kept wonderfully well; and it is of the
utmost importance that it should remain unknown
in the future&mdash;at least so far as we are concerned.
Olozaga<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in Paris was not initiated. Serrano and
Prim were the men who held the matter in their
hands."</p></blockquote>

<p>A month later Prince Charles Anthony wrote:
"Bismarck is very discontented with the failure of
the Spanish combination. He is not wrong! Still
the matter is not yet completely given up. It
still hangs by a couple of threads, as weak as
those of a spider's web!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To return, however, to the affairs of Roumania;
Prince Charles opened the new mint at Bucharest
in March, when the first Roumanian coins bearing
a profile of the Prince and the inscription "Prince
of the Roumanians" were struck. The coins consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Carols d'or</i> in gold and one <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">leu</i> (franc) in
silver. Ali Pacha at once protested formally
against the illegal coinage with the Prince's likeness,
and refused to allow it to circulate in Turkey.
Owing, however, to the support of Austria and
France, this difficulty was eventually smoothed
over satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Financial difficulties, coupled with the unsatisfactory
reports on the Roumanian railway
concessions, led to the fall of the Golesku Ministry
in April. M. E. C. Jepureanu succeeded in
forming a new Cabinet, which received cordial
support from abroad as well as at home. The
vexatious Jewish question and the very serious
state of the railway finances, for which the
Opposition sought to make the Prince personally
responsible, were the chief of the many difficulties
of the Government.</p>

<p>The result of the general election was by no
means as favourable as the Prince had been led to
expect, and a serious riot occurred at Pitéschti.
The troops were called out and ordered to fire
upon the mob, several of the soldiers having been
wounded by stones. Similar occurrences took
place at Plojeschti, a regular hot-bed of seditious
intrigue, and the National Guard of that town had
to be subsequently disbanded for taking part in
the political demonstrations.</p>

<p>The attention of Prince Charles was suddenly
averted by a change in his eldest brother's views<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
with regard to the Spanish throne. Prince
Leopold had at last decided to accept the crown
under certain definite conditions, as he had become
convinced of the great services which he could
thus render to his Fatherland. King William at
once gave his consent, and Don Salazar returned
to Madrid on June 23 with the news of Prince
Leopold's readiness to accept the crown. An
unfortunate mistake in a cypher telegram caused
the Cortes to be prorogued from June 24 to
October 31, and the election of Prince Leopold
was therefore delayed until late in the autumn,
thus offering ample opportunities to malcontents
for the prosecution of intrigues and agitations
against the Hohenzollern candidature.</p>

<p>The <cite>Agence Havas</cite> reported from Madrid on
July 3 that the Spanish Ministry had decided
upon the candidature of the Hereditary Prince of
Hohenzollern, and that a deputation were already
on their way to the Prince. This news caused
the greatest excitement throughout Paris, and the
French Ambassador at Berlin was commissioned
to express to the Foreign Office the "painful surprise"
caused by these tidings. The Prussian
Secretary of State replied that the matter did not
concern the Prussian Government. The excitement
of the Parisian Press increased from hour to
hour, whilst the Duc de Gramont, in an interview
with the Prussian Ambassador, declared that the
Emperor would never tolerate the candidature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a Hohenzollern Prince; and M. Ollivier, who was
also present, expressed the same opinion. Gramont
also openly accused Prince Charles of having
induced his brother to take this step, and remarked
to M. Strat, the Roumanian agent: "As
soon as Prince Charles conspires against the
interests of France, it is only fair that we should
do our best to overthrow him, and we shall at
once commence action in the event of a war with
Prussia, in order to satisfy public opinion, which
has so often reproached the Emperor with having
sent a Hohenzollern to the Danube."</p>

<p>King William wrote to Prince Charles Anthony
on the 10th, mentioning that France was obviously
bent upon war, and that he was as willing to sanction
Leopold's withdrawal as he had formerly been to
assent to his acceptance of the offered throne.
Two days later the Hereditary Prince withdrew
his name by means of a telegram from his father
to Marshal Prim:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Having regard to the complicated interests
which appear to oppose the candidature of my son
Leopold for the Spanish throne, and the painful
position which recent events have created for the
Spanish people by offering them an alternative
where their sense of liberty alone can guide them,
and being convinced that under such circumstances
their votes, on which my son counted in
accepting the candidature, can neither be sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
nor spontaneous, I withdraw from the position in
his name.</p>

<p class="sig">
"PRINCE OF HOHENZOLLERN.</p>

<p class="noind">
"<span class="smcap">Sigmaringen</span>, <i>July 12th, 1870</i>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The unexpected and unheard-of demands which
Benedetti was forced by his Government to submit
to King William at Ems shattered the last
hopes of peace, and France declared war against
Prussia.</p>

<p>In spite of the nationality of their Prince, the
Roumanian nation sided entirely with France:
"Wherever the banner of France waves, there are
our sympathies and interests." The Chamber
demanded that the Government should explain
the policy it intended to adopt with regard to the
belligerent parties, but, though the Ministry
adhered to a strictly neutral attitude, a motion
was passed to the effect that the sympathies of
Roumania would always be with the Latin race.</p>

<p>The Roumanian agent in Paris, M. Strat, telegraphed
to know whether, in the event of Russia
taking part in the war, the Roumanian Government
would conclude a treaty with France or not! The
apparently peaceable intentions of Russia pointed
to a treaty merely on paper, notwithstanding
which Roumania would reap advantages at the
conclusion of peace. Austria had been sounded
on this question, and approved of supporting
Prince Charles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The Roumanian Government replied: "If France
categorically demands from us the signature of a
treaty to influence our attitude towards Russia in
the event of Oriental complications, you are empowered
to conclude such a treaty on the following
basis: the Roumanian Government is resolved
to oppose any hostile movement of Russia hand-in-hand
with the Western Powers and Turkey.
Mavrogheni has been specially sent to England
to negotiate to the same end. We can place a
well-equipped army of 30,000 men into the
field."</p>

<p>The <cite>Times</cite>, on July 26, published a draft of a
treaty drawn up in 1867, in which France offered
Prussia the union of the North German Confederation
with South Germany and a united Parliament
in return for the sacrifice of Belgium and
Luxemburg. This epoch-making announcement
was confirmed by a despatch from Count Bismarck,
received on the 29th. Count Benedetti,
in whose handwriting and on whose paper this
draft was written, maintained that he had merely
put down the Chancellors ideas, "as it were at
his dictation," a statement which caused the
greatest surprise even in the French Press.</p>

<p>The minor engagement at Saarbrücken, the
"baptism by fire" of the unfortunate Prince
Imperial, was reported as a great French victory,
and greeted as such with unbounded enthusiasm by
the inhabitants of Bucharest. These rejoicings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
were, however, cut short by the news of the
German victories at Weissenburg, Wörth, and
Spichern, when the Imperial Army was forced
to retreat on Metz. In consequence of these
disasters the Gramont-Ollivier Ministry was
defeated, and a new Cabinet formed under Count
Palikao.</p>

<p>A most interesting letter from Prince Charles
Anthony was received at Bucharest on August 16:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I decidedly support Strat, for he has proved
himself a devoted and faithful servant to you and
to our family.</p>

<p>"He arrived at Sigmaringen at a moment
when the French Government was peculiarly
exasperated. It was from him that I learnt the
actual spirit and intention in Paris; it was due
to him that I published Leopold's renunciation
twenty-four hours earlier perhaps than I should
have done without his urgent advice. In neutralising
the French pretext for war, by making the
renunciation public at the right moment, the
Franco-Prussian War has, perhaps, become a
<em>popular</em>, <i>i.e.</i>, a <em>German</em>, war. Any delay on my
part would have given the war a dynastic complexion,
and the whole of Southern Germany
would have left Prussia in the lurch....
Napoleon has brought about the unity of
Germany in twenty-four hours."</p></blockquote>

<p>The excitement in Roumania culminated in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
attempted revolution in that hot-bed of sedition,
Plojeschti, on August 29, when the militia barracks
were stormed and a proclamation issued,
deposing Prince Charles and appointing General
A. Golesku regent <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad interim</i>. A deputy, Candianu
Popesku, at the head of the mob, entered
the telegraph office and, revolver in hand,
threatened to shoot the clerks, unless they telegraphed
the news of the deposition of the Prince
to the foreign countries and the larger towns of
Roumania. With admirable presence of mind the
clerks reported the occurrence to the Ministry at
Bucharest instead of complying with the insurgents'
demands. A battalion of Rifles under
Major Gorjan was immediately despatched to the
scene of the insurrection, which they promptly
quelled. Both General Golesku and J. Bratianu,
who appeared to be implicated in these affairs,
were arrested at once, but were soon released by
order of Prince Charles, who expressed his conviction
that the insurgents had used their names
without any authorisation. On being arrested,
Bratianu begged that his papers might be left
undisturbed, for, as he remarked with a smile, he
was "<em>too experienced a conspirator</em>" to retain
possession of compromising documents. Some
twenty persons were arrested in connection with
this affair, though, as Prince Charles wrote to his
father, it seemed improbable that there was sufficient
evidence to convict them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The news of a great battle fought near Sedan
caused the wildest excitement in Bucharest, and
elaborate arrangements were made to celebrate a
French victory. Rumours were current that King
William had been taken prisoner with a force
varying from 20,000 to 60,000 men, but a telegram
announcing the voluntary surrender of the
Emperor seemed to point, at any rate, to an
undecided action. When the truth became
known the greatest consternation prevailed in
the Roumanian capital, where, in spite of the
earlier German victories, the hope of the eventual
success of the French arms had never been quite
relinquished. The crowning defeat of the Imperial
Army was followed by the flight of the Empress-Regent
and the fall of the Napoleonic dynasty.</p>

<p>The birth of a daughter, Marie, on September 8,
at a moment when the whole of Germany stood
shoulder to shoulder against their foe, was welcomed
by the Prince and Princess as a happy
omen for the future. In accordance with the
Constitution the child was baptised according to
the rites of the Orthodox Church in the church of
Cotroceni, on October 13, in the presence of the
heads of the military and civil departments. A
salute of twenty-one guns announced the moment
of the ceremony to the capital.</p>

<p>The joyful news of the birth of a Princess was
communicated to the various Courts and to the
deposed French Emperor, who replied as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">

"<span class="smcap">My dear Prince</span>,
</p>

<p>"I thank you for the letter which you have
kindly written to inform me of the birth of
Princess Marie. I shall always take a lively
interest in all that contributes to your happiness;
and I pray that family joys may sweeten the
bitterness inseparable from power. I am much
touched by the memories you have preserved of
your visit to Paris, and I again assure you of the
sentiments of sincere friendship with which I
remain</p>

<p>
"Your most Serene Highness's cousin,</p>

<p class="sig">"NAPOLEON."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The call of duty, however, prevented Prince
Charles from devoting as much time as he otherwise
would have done to his wife and daughter,
for the disquieting effects of the German victories
upon French soil were felt only too plainly in
Roumania. The work on the railways, too, had
suffered in consequence of the war, whilst the
exports of grain had practically fallen to zero.
Farmers and peasants were unable to sell their
produce except at ruinous prices, and were wholly
unable to pay their taxes. As the Prince had
prophesied six weeks before, the Plojeschti insurgents
were all acquitted by the jury. The Ministry
wished to resign as a proof of their disapprobation,
but Prince Charles was unable to accede to their
request.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The acquittal of those who had sought to overthrow
the Government confirmed the Prince in
his intention to abdicate as soon as he could
assure himself that the country would not lapse
into absolute anarchy. He had already assured
the representatives of the Great Powers that the
present state of affairs in Roumania could not
and <em>must not</em> continue. Prince Charles, however,
did not inform them that he would not be
beholden to any foreign intervention for his future
career, and that, in his father's words, he would
relinquish his self-imposed task if he could not
"anchor his power solely and exclusively in
Roumania." He felt that it would be impossible
for him to govern the country after foreign intervention
had taken place.</p>

<p>Prince Charles had taken a solemn oath to the
Constitution, and therefore could not depart from
it, though Roumanian statesmen of both parties
had frequently represented to him that, when a
choice had to be made between a "sheet of paper
and a country's ruin," one must not hesitate
to tear up the paper. It was, however, impossible
for Prince Charles to agree to this view, for the
Constitution was more to him than a piece of
paper, even though it offered him no means of
securing the prosperity and development of the
country.</p>

<p>In the meantime the action of Russia in declaring
its intention of disregarding the neutralisation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of the Black Sea, decreed by the Treaty of
Paris in 1856, threatened to create yet another
European crisis. When the Note containing this
information was handed to the Grand Vizier, he
at once asked whether M. de Stahl was bringing
him war. "On the contrary," replied the Ambassador,
"I bring you eternal peace." Before this
General Ignatieff had endeavoured to persuade
the Turkish statesmen that, though the Western
Powers endeavoured to represent Russia as the
evil genius of Turkey, she was in reality the most
sincere ally of the Ottoman Empire. The Sultan
would never be able to reckon on Germany, whose
policy would always be selfish and ambitious.
Austria, too, was only intent on annexing Bosnia
and Herzegowina, whilst France, on the other
hand, as soon as she had recovered from her
reverses, would, next to Russia, be the most
effective supporter of Turkey. The Sublime Porte
was convinced that Russia had obtained the consent
of Germany, though Count Bismarck had
telegraphed that the Russian declaration had been
a painful surprise to him.</p>

<p>The Note created a storm of indignation in
Austria and England, which Bismarck increased
still more by proposing the assembly of a Conference
in London to settle the vexed question.</p>

<p>After a long discussion with the President of
the Ministry, Prince Charles decided to explain
the situation in Roumania to the guaranteeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Powers. The wording of the document, however,
caused great difficulties, for, if the Prince declared
his firm intention of abdicating, the country would
be exposed to the danger of annexation, whereas
the Prince wished above all things to preserve the
autonomy of the State, and to assure its future
prosperity by strengthening the hands of the
Government. Prince Charles in these letters
expressed his regret that he was no longer able
to curb the passions of the various Roumanian
parties, and therefore suggested that the future of
Roumania should be regulated by the proposed
Congress. Only a stable and a strong government
could remedy the internal and external evils of
the country, which at present was in the most
deplorable condition, despite the wealth of its
resources. The letters for the sovereigns of the
guaranteeing Powers were handed to their representatives
on December 7, except that addressed
to the Sultan, which was kept back until a reply
was received from the British Ambassador, who
had been asked to present it to the Sultan, to
ensure the document being kept strictly secret.</p>

<p>These letters had hardly been despatched when
the following telegram was received from Count
Bismarck by the Prussian Consul-General:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Advocate His Highness delaying any decision
to appeal to the guaranteeing Powers until after
the conclusion of peace. Any Roumanian complication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
would be doubly undesirable at present:
the Prince could not even hope for our moral
support."</p></blockquote>

<p>Prince Charles replied that this advice had
reached him too late, and that complications in
the East could not possibly arise, as the documents
in question were to be kept private. So
far as he was concerned personally his position
was neither of service to Roumania nor to Europe,
whilst he himself was exposed to contumely; he
therefore could not much longer continue to bear
the responsibilities of government.</p>

<p>To crown the difficulties of the Prince's position
information reached him on December 18 that
the railway contractor was unwilling or unable to
pay the coupon of the bonds due on January 1.
The blow was indeed a bitter one, for the thought
that it was to him that Roumania owed its railway
system had always been one of comfort. It
suggested at least <em>one</em> service which he had been
able to render his adopted country. Now that even
this last consolation had been taken from him, Prince
Charles was still more firmly convinced that he
could not forsake Roumania in its day of peril,
and that his cherished plan of abdication must
not take place until this serious financial trouble
had been settled.</p>

<p>It was during these dark days that he poured
out his innermost thoughts to his truest friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
his father: "When once this enormous difficulty
has been surmounted I shall be able to say that
I have stood the ordeal of fire; then the cruel
sport will be finished; then you will find me some
spot where I can rest my weary head&mdash;some
quiet remote corner where one can entirely forget
oneself for a time. Switzerland would be the
most welcome to me; there we might blot out the
hard separation of five years in your company,
my dearest parents. But for the present these
are but pious wishes, since I cannot to-day fix the
moment of their fulfilment: may it not be long in
coming!"</p>

<p>The Chamber found worthy representatives&mdash;the
chief instigators of the recent insurrection&mdash;to
convey the scandalously worded address to the
ruler who had never a thought save for the
welfare and prosperity of his country.</p>

<p>In reply to that passage of the Speech from
the Throne referring to the Plojeschti sedition&mdash;"A
free government, that is, one which is always
in agitation, cannot maintain itself without laws
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">capable de correction</i>"&mdash;the Chamber declared
that "the best means to prevent such occurrences
in the future would be compliance with the
wishes of the people and respect for the law!"
Prince Charles informed his Ministers that he
could not accept an address couched in such
terms, but eventually gave way to their prayers
and entreaties that he would not offer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Opposition such an opportunity for attacking the
dynasty. The ill-considered action of passionate
and reckless Deputies, they urged, would only
gain an importance which it otherwise would have
lacked, from the fact of the Prince refusing to
acknowledge it.</p>

<p>A most interesting document, dated December
22, 1870, the publication of which at a later
period had so far-reaching an effect on the
Roumanian nation, contains the reasons which led
Prince Charles to confess himself beaten.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nearly five years have now passed since I
formed the bold resolution of placing myself
at the head of this country, so richly endowed
by Mother Nature, and yet, in other respects, so
poor. On reviewing this period, so short in the
life of a nation, so long in the existence of a man,
I must confess that I have not been able to be
of much use to this beautiful country. I often
ask myself the question, 'At whose door does
the fault lie&mdash;at mine, in being ignorant of the
character of this nation, or at that of the nation,
which will neither allow itself to be guided nor
understand how to guide itself?'</p>

<p>"My numerous journeys in all parts of the two
Principalities, and my many-sided intercourse with
all grades of society have almost convinced me
that the real blame rests not on me personally,
nor on the majority of the nation, but rather on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
those who have constituted themselves the leaders
of the country which gave them birth. These
men, the greater number of whom owe their
social and political education to foreign countries,
and have thereby only too thoroughly forgotten
the condition of their own country, aim solely at
transplanting to their Fatherland the ideas they
have gained abroad by casting them into Utopian
form, without having tested them. This unfortunate
country, which formerly suffered so
much oppression, has thus passed at one bound
from a despotic government to a Liberal constitution
such as no other nation in Europe
possesses.</p>

<p>"My experiences lead me to consider this the
greater misfortune since the Roumanians can
boast of none of the citizenly virtues which
appertain to such a quasi-republican form of State.</p>

<p>"Had I not taken to my heart this magnificent
country, for which, under other circumstances, the
richest future might have been foretold, I should
have lost patience long ago; but I have now made
one final effort which will perhaps cause me to
appear unkind to my country in the eyes of the
parties, as well as in those of the national
Roumanian leaders, by putting all personal considerations
behind me, and possibly by completely
sacrificing my popularity; it would, however, have
been an inexcusable neglect of duty to conceal
this evil any longer, or to permit the country's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
future to be sacrificed to party intrigues. The
man who has the courage to speak the truth and
to call things by their right names will often get
the worst of the bargain, and this in all probability
will be my fate. Yet I gratefully recognise
this difference, that I am at liberty to return to
an independent life, free from care, to the joys of
home and family in my native land, that powerful
magnet which has never ceased to attract me in
the heavy hours through which I have been
passing.</p>

<p>"I regret with my whole heart that my good
intentions have been so misconstrued and rewarded
by ingratitude; but, since I share this fate with
the majority of mortals, I shall learn to console
myself and by degrees forget what once I aimed
at, in intercourse with congenial spirits. I
shall accept the address of the Chamber to-morrow,
a masterpiece of Phanariot perfidy, the
contents of which will reach you through the
papers. The only circumstance which can justify
my acceptance of a document in which a legislative
body dares to speak to the Sovereign of
conditional allegiance is the serious financial
situation of the country, threatened as it is by
bankruptcy. Just as in private life the disapproval
of an action can only affect the agent, so in this
case the entire responsibility falls on the shoulders
of those who do not understand how to honour
the Prince whom they have themselves chosen&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
man dishonours himself when he does not know
how to respect that which he has himself created.</p>

<p class="sig">
"C."
</p></blockquote>

<p>A series of passionate debates, which at times
threatened to end in violence, resulted in a vote
of no confidence in the Ministry on December 24.
Prince Jon Ghika succeeded in forming what must
under the circumstances be termed a strong
Ministry, and declared that his policy lay in
effecting a compromise between the Prince, who
had lost all confidence in the country, and the
representatives of the people.</p>

<p>The North German Consul-General handed the
following letter from Prince Bismarck to the
Prince on January 19, 1871, dated from Versailles,
January 10:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... I cannot form an opinion of the internal
conditions of Roumania, nor of the means at the
disposal of your Highness for conquering the prevailing
difficulties and establishing your government
on a secure footing.</p>

<p>"I must assume that the impediments, due to
the character and previous history of the nation,
almost prohibit an orderly existence for the State,
since the noble intentions and the pure ideals which
animate your Highness have hitherto failed to
create institutions which would assist the execution
of your plans. Your Highness alone can judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
whether any hope still exists that these institutions
may yet be created....</p>

<p>"No matter what the causes are, nor how many
misunderstandings and misrepresentations have
contributed to the result, it is certain that the
distrust of the Porte has not been allayed, and
that it is still unconvinced that the union of the
Principalities under the rule of your Highness is
not dangerous to its suzerainty. Nor is it confident
that the conditions, which might force
your Highness to abdicate, will be more disquieting
to the peace of the East than the present
situation.</p>

<p>"The English Government has never taken an
interest in the Danube Principalities nor in the
fortunes of your Highness personally, and the
attitude of its representatives abroad does not at
present appear to inspire confidence. Although I
do not positively pre-suppose a hostile feeling in
London, it may be accepted as certain that on
this question England's policy will not greatly
differ from that of the Sultan.</p>

<p>"At this moment France, of course, need not
be taken into consideration, except so far as there
is a possibility of her opposing your Highness by
intrigues and secret agitation in the hope of doing
Prussia some ill-turn or injury....</p>

<p>"I have for a long time cherished the hope that
your Highness would find effectual support in St.
Petersburg, and have therefore always recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
cordial relations with Russia. Even now
I do not doubt the personal views of his
Majesty the Czar, who, I am sure, retains the best
and most friendly wishes for your person. But
I have been regretfully forced to recognise,
especially of late, that this personal good-will is
out-weighed by the traditional conception of
Russian policy, which is opposed to the union of
the Principalities. The fact that your Highness
must expect no support from Russia, not even in
diplomacy, is in accordance with this traditional
policy, whilst the hostile attitude towards your
Highness in Vienna appears to me to lack any
logical explanation, considered from the standpoint
of Austro-Hungarian policy.</p>

<p>"It is only natural that your Highness should
look to the illustrious Head of your house, to
Prussia and Germany. Your Highness is well
aware of the views with which his Majesty the
King regards your person, but you know also that
the present military situation renders it impossible
for Germany to intervene effectually in Eastern
affairs under the circumstances we have been considering.</p>

<p>"On reviewing all these considerations I can
only arrive at the conclusion that your Highness
cannot expect any outside assistance, but rather
ill-will, and that your decisions must be based
solely upon the means of support which are
still left to you in your own country. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
expect a crisis, for the defeat of which you consider
the better elements of the country insufficient, it
appears to be a duty to yourself and to your house
that your every decision should be really independent
and voluntary, and should not seem to be
forced upon you by foreign force; and the high
and noble motives which guide your Highness
should stand prominently forth.</p>

<p>"It pains me to be able to give no other counsel
to your Highness and to offer you no better hopes.
But I know that your patriotic sympathy and
hearty joy at the successes of our German army,
and at the glory which surrounds the revered
head of our King, will not be affected even by the
painful experience your Highness has endured,
and I conclude with the hope that your wishes
for an honourable and safe peace may soon be
fulfilled."</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter addressed to the Sultan, which had
been delayed until an answer was received from
the British Ambassador, was eventually forwarded
by the Prince with a voluntary explanation of the
delay. Ali Pacha in reply expressed the concern
with which the Sultan had heard of the critical
situation of affairs in the Principalities.</p>

<p>At the same time Prince Charles was informed
from a trustworthy source that in Constantinople,
as well as in other places, his position was considered
untenable. "The Government of Prince Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
is universally recognised to have had its day, and
the representatives of the Powers here are more
occupied in considering what may happen after
the departure of the Prince than in any scheme
for prolonging his rule. Sir H. Elliott goes
furthest of all, and already speaks of commissaries
who must be sent to the Principalities, and whose
departure he wishes to take place at once...."
The same writer, Count Keyserling, also adjured
the Prince to hope for no outside aid. "The only
choice, therefore, lies between the continuance of
the present <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, to which even your Highness's
worst foe could not advise you, and a separation
from a country and a nation which, oblivious of
the fact that their Prince has shown an almost
superhuman devotion to his duties, have sinned a
thousand times against the person of their ruler,
whom they themselves elected, and to whom they
took the oath of allegiance and obedience.</p>

<p>"The Grand Vizier asked me in a very significant
manner: 'Do you think that, after Prince
Charles's experience, another Prince of a reigning
house could be found for Roumania?'&mdash;and then
answered his own question: 'Except, perhaps,
Prince Napoleon, I can think of no one; and we
desire to have nothing at all to do with him&mdash;as
little as with a republic.'"</p>

<p>Prince Charles replied to Count Bismarck's
letter on January 27, 1871, thanking him for the
sympathy he had shown for the ruler of Roumania,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
if not for the country itself, and assuring him of
the heartfelt interest and joy with which the
recent military events in France inspired him.
He continued: "The situation here is serious;
for the present I can avail myself of the Party
intrigues to maintain my position as long as I
consider it suitable and advisable. I have to act
like a ship's captain, who must remain at his post
day and night during a storm. The waves now
sweep my ship to the skies, now dash it down to
the depths, but as surely as God is my helper I
will not let it be wrecked! To-day the crew
would willingly throw me overboard, but a
few of them still possess sufficient intelligence
to know that I alone can steer them safely into
port.</p>

<p>"I will not lose sight of two points; I intend to
bring my name clean and unspotted out of this
turmoil, but I will not heartlessly and without a
conscience leave <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le déluge après moi</i>. This refers,
above all, to the finances, the desertion of which
might be fraught with grave danger both at home
and abroad."</p>

<p>The letter already referred to, in which Prince
Charles set forth the reasons which led him to
think of abdicating, was published in the columns
of the <cite>Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>, and created
the greatest excitement in Roumania. A discussion
in the Chamber upon the authenticity of this
document took place on February 11, 1871, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
a Deputy, N. Blaramberg, declared that either the
letter was a forgery, or that the Prince was about
to abdicate and leave Roumania to the tender
mercies of its enemies. "A Prince who quits his
country in its hour of danger may be compared to
a deserter or a traitor to the State!"</p>

<p>The President of the Ministry was unable to
deny the authenticity of the document, but
assured the Chamber that the views contained in
it, if they were ever actually current, prevailed no
longer. Cogalniceanu then proposed the following
counter-resolution: "The Chamber, deeply
moved by the explanations communicated by the
Ministry, expresses its devotion to the Throne
and Dynasty, guaranteed by the Constitution,
and proceeds to the order of the day with every
confidence in the future of the country, and in
the firm resolve to adhere to the Constitution."</p>

<p>An infinitely more loyal tone prevailed in the
Senate, where the contents of Prince Charles's
letter were also discussed. A resolution was
carried with only four dissentients to the effect
that the chief duty of the Senate lay in supporting
the Sovereign whom the nation had so enthusiastically
elevated to the throne, and that the
consolidation of the dynasty was indissolubly
bound up with the peace, existence, and political
development of the country.</p>

<p>The reports of the Roumanian agents abroad
showed that, though the Powers were unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to take any steps to support Prince Charles, they
were, nevertheless, anxious that his abdication
should be deferred for the present. The separation
of the two Principalities, each under a native
ruler, would be acceptable to Russia, Austria, and
England, provided no anarchical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">interregnum</i> took
place. The Sublime Porte, accordingly, was
anxious that the Prince should remain at his post,
until the question of his successors was definitely
settled. As the great German Chancellor remarked,
it appeared that the uncertain possibilities
of a catastrophe on the Lower Danube,
coupled with the fear of further complications, had
resulted in a sort of repentance on the part of the
Powers for the intrigues against the consolidation
of the Roumanian State. Austria in particular now
saw clearly that the mistrust with which Roumania
had always been regarded under Prince Charles,
owing to the fear that she was merely a tool in
the hands of Prussia, was utterly unfounded.</p>

<p>Prince Charles Anthony wrote to his sorely
tried son:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The description of your position has gone to
my heart; I have sorrowed and suffered with you....
I have always found that a healthy constitutionalism
is the corrective for caprice, and the
support of a strong Government, and that, where
the system is honestly employed by both sides, it
has always maintained itself; but where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
only used as a cloak for anarchical tendencies, it
is noxious and confusing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"It can never injure your personal reputation
if you lay down a task you are unable to complete.
You have shown the whole world your
good intentions and your qualifications for governing
Roumania. You did not force yourself upon
the country, but were elected and summoned
thither; you have founded great institutions,
regenerated the army and created a new system
of communications, and conferred innumerable
benefits on the Church and the poor; you have
protected the arts and sciences, and by your
family happiness testified to the sanctity of marriage;
liberality of all kinds has been supported
by your purse&mdash;all this secures for you, if not at
present, at least eventually, a blessed memory,
and proves to your contemporaries, in the event of
your abdication, that it was not the imaginary
splendour of this veritable crown of thorns that
blinded and deceived you, but that it was the
shipwreck of your honest intentions and your
thirst for useful labour that matured your decision
and helped it to issue in act.</p>

<p>"I already dream of a family life which would
be the consolation of my old age. Looking backward
to an eventful past, you would find the
same spiritual compensation that I find in the
peaceful life that lies before me, but with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
difference, that a longer life than mine will be
vouchsafed to you.... Krauchenwies offers a
suitable and comfortable home, in forty minutes
you can reach Sigmaringen.... If Krauchenwies
does not suit you, you might live at Inzigkofen,
and if not at Inzigkofen, then at one of the
Hechingen manors, such as Lindich or Villa
Eugenia...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet even darker troubles lay before Prince Charles
Anthony's courageous son, in the defalcations of
Dr. Strousberg in the matter of the Roumanian
railways. As the January coupon still remained
unpaid, the Prussian Government threatened to
use pressure to force the Roumanian Government
to act in accordance with its guarantee. Unfortunately
the Principalities were absolutely unable
to comply with this demand, and indignant sentiments
prevailed regarding everything that was
German. The passions excited amongst the population
of Bucharest culminated in an attack on the
German colony on the occasion of a banquet given
in honour of the German Emperor's birthday on
March 22, 1871. A riotous mob quickly assembled,
broke the windows of the house, and attempted to
force their way up to the first floor. At nine
o'clock Major Skina hastened to the Prince and
informed him that the demonstration, which had
been started half an hour previously by a few
youths, had already attained serious dimensions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
that the windows were bombarded with stones,
and that the police remained entirely passive.
The Prince at once despatched his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aide-de-camp</i> to
find the President of the Ministry and the Prefect
of Police, but neither of them was to be found.
The excitement increased with every minute, until
at length the mob, having extinguished the street
lamps, raised the cries: "To the Palace!" and
"Long live the Republic!"</p>

<p>General Solomon, the Commandant of Bucharest,
now occupied the streets with troops, in spite of
the efforts of the President of the Ministry,
Jon Ghika, to prevent so violent a course. The
mob obeyed the order to disperse after having
been in possession of the streets for about two and
a half hours.</p>

<p>Prince Charles received Consul-General von
Radowitz the same night, and, after expressing his
regret at this disgraceful occurrence, mentioned
that he had already taken the first steps towards
replacing the guilty Ministers. At one <small>A.M.</small> next
morning Jon Ghika arrived at the Palace, and
eventually succeeded in convincing the Prince
that the cause of the outrage was in no way to
be attributed to him. Prince Charles, however,
demanded his resignation, and informed him that
he intended to summon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lieutenance Princière</i>
in the morning to resign the reins of government
to them.</p>

<p>Accordingly at ten o'clock D. Sturdza was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
commissioned to summon the members of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lieutenance Princière</i> of 1866 to meet the Prince
at the Palace at half-past eleven. The Prince
then informed them of his intention to place the
government in their hands, after having held it
for nearly five years.</p>

<p>Lascar Catargiu and N. Golesku&mdash;Colonel
Haralambi was not in Bucharest at that time&mdash;both
adjured the Prince to abstain from a step
which they felt convinced would bring the greatest
misfortune upon Roumania. The State would lapse
into complete anarchy after such an action on
the Prince's part, and they therefore respectfully
declined to accept the burden of such a responsibility.
At length the earnest entreaties of the
two Roumanians gained the day, and Prince
Charles consented to reconsider his decision, if a
strong and loyal Ministry could be formed. Should
this be impossible, or should the Chamber decline
to vote the Budget, he would at once leave the
country.</p>

<p>A secret sitting of the Chamber took place the
same afternoon, when Lascar Catargiu informed
the Deputies of the interview which had taken
place in the morning. A passionate debate
ensued on the question whether further negotiations
with the head of the State should be
commenced or not. In spite of the windy utterances
of the leaders of the Extreme Democrats
and Independents, it soon became apparent that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a comparatively large majority supported the
dynasty.</p>

<p>Lascar Catargiu succeeded in forming a Ministry
composed of men who had already won their spurs
in the arena of politics; but he was unable to
induce the Chamber to vote the Budget. The
Chamber was therefore dissolved forthwith, and
with it the whole agitation ceased. It had always
been confined to the capital.</p>

<p>The following letter was received from the
Emperor William on March 30, 1871:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Accept my heartiest thanks for your affectionate
and welcome congratulations for the 22nd.
This time, certainly, the day overflowed with
feelings of gratitude towards Providence, which
decreed that I, aided by my army and the self-sacrifice
of my people, should achieve things, to
expect or demand which at the commencement
of this glorious but bloody war would have been
presumption. The Almighty has guided and
secured all, and we must rejoice that He has
found us worthy to be His instruments. The
foundations of a new German Empire have been
laid, and the blood shed has been made into a
mortar with which we may hope that a strong
house will be built upon <em>this</em> foundation, under the
wise guidance of my successors.</p>

<p>
"With heartiest greetings to the Princess,<br />
"I remain, your faithful Cousin and Friend,</p>

<p class="sig">"WILLIAM."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I say nothing about your situation, and
can only pray that the Lord may help you to
choose whatever way is right and best."</p></blockquote>

<p>In reply, Prince Charles expressed his grief
that March 22, an anniversary so dear to him,
should have been troubled by such an occurrence
in Bucharest. "Nothing could have wounded me
more deeply than that this particular occasion
should have been seized for the outbreak of a
long-smouldering intrigue.... Having regard to
the critical situation, especially that of the great
and calamitous financial question, I was forced to
take extreme steps to rally the better element
from its apathy. I therefore summoned the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lieutenance</i>, from whose hands I had received the
reins of government in 1866, in order to return
them their trust. Terrified by this imminent
danger, all the Conservative factions combined to
form the new Ministry. To-day it is a point of
honour with me to support with all my might
those men, who are resolved to protect the
country against serious complications, and in conjunction
with them to carry out the necessary
reforms. Should these prove unattainable with
the aid of such supporters, the country will be
irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>"It cannot be denied that the state of affairs is
very serious, and that the creation of a better
state of things is beset with the greatest difficulties:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the future is hidden from me in impenetrable
darkness. But the greater the danger, the less
must one's courage be allowed to sink!"</p>

<p>Catargiu informed the Prince that an attempt
was to be made on his life during the evening
service on Good Friday, and endeavoured to persuade
him not to proceed to the Metropolie.
During the procession the Ministers surrounded
the Prince in order to protect his person, but fortunately
nothing occurred to disturb the ceremony.</p>

<p>Count Keyserling, who in many ways proved
his sincere friendship and admiration for the
Prince, wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Prince Bismarck lays special stress on your
Highness's maintaining the very best relations
with the Porte at this moment. Ali Pacha, for
his part, is inclined in your favour. Your
Highness and the present Cabinet will be sincerely
supported in Constantinople by the
Austrians: England's attitude, on the other
hand, is thoroughly ambiguous. Lord Granville
has spoken to the Turkish Ambassador and Count
Apponyi in London in a strain which suggests
that one is listening to Mr. Green, the English
Consul in Bucharest, holding forth upon his own
financial interests."</p></blockquote>

<p>The same view was held by Prince Charles
Anthony:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I reserve my further views on the situation,
because I have been unable to get any information
about your own opinions. In any case, it was well
to show the world by a last attempt that it was
not from want of courage that the thought of
abdication arose.</p>

<p>"You must hold out to the limits of possibility,
and, when once they are reached, you must
demand guarantees that a period of stability will
then commence, for to allow oneself to be blown
hither and thither like a frail reed, and to depend
upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon vouloir</i> of each Ministry is no
position for a Hohenzollern.</p>

<p>"Under prevailing circumstances I can only
give you one word of advice, and that is to lean
upon Turkey: this Power has the greatest interest
in the peace of Roumania&mdash;the interest of self-preservation&mdash;and
she will inspire none of the
other protecting States with distrust....</p>

<p>"Nothing can be done in the Strousberg affair;
an independent court of law alone can succeed in
settling this impending financial difficulty. Moreover,
this Strousberg question is only an empty
pretext and means of agitation against you; the
whole movement in Roumania is based upon
hostility towards the German dynasty, and is the
result of socialist-republican intrigue!"</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>FINANCIAL TROUBLES</h3>


<p class="noind">Perhaps the chief amongst the many obstacles
which beset the path of Prince Charles in his task
of raising Roumania from the depth to which it
had sunk was the very serious state of the
national finances. The effect of the previous
drains upon the country's resources, and the
expense of keeping an army prepared to meet any
emergency, caused by the hostile attitude of
Turkey, were thus summed up by the Prince in
July 1866.</p>

<p>"The worst wound of the country is at present
its finances. We have not a penny, in the
literal sense of the word, and the Ministry, in
order to restore the equilibrium of the Budget,
has to adopt measures which will scarcely gain
friends for us: the taxes have to be raised; 30 per
cent. of salaries and pensions, which have not been
paid for four months, have to be kept back. For
my part, I have surrendered another 12,000 ducats
of my Civil List. Only a loan can save us now;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
we are in communication with financiers, but their
conditions are more than hard. With patience
we shall yet escape from this calamity, but for
the moment the situation is very difficult. Retrenchment
must be made, wherever possible."</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that, whilst the receipts
amounted to only 56,000,000 francs in the first
year of the Prince's rule, they reached the total of
180,000,000 in 1891, being thus more than trebled
in twenty-five years.</p>

<p>Though the financial situation was only slightly
improved during 1867,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Prince Charles entered
in the autumn of that year into negotiations
with the Austrian financier, Herr von Ofenheim,
for the construction of a railway from Suceava to
Bucharest, passing through Jassy and Galatz.
These negotiations, commenced as far back as 1862,
had been allowed to drop; and Roumania had thus
lost the favourable moment for appealing to the
British money market, which, moreover, was never
at any time favourable to the enterprise. However,
Ofenheim's Syndicate, which included three
Englishmen (amongst them Mr. T. Brassey),
arranged for the construction of the line, which was
to be built by sections, commencing with 110 miles
from Suceava to Roman. How necessary railways
were to the country is shown by the fact that
only a quarter of the corn and wood intended for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
export that year could be moved by ship to its
destination. Eventually the Chamber confirmed
the Ofenheim concession, voting 230,000 francs
for the first section, and a subsidy of 40,000 francs
per kilometer.</p>

<p>Ofenheim only undertook to carry out the
northern half of the concession, and ceded the
southern portion to a Prussian syndicate, of which
the well-known financier, Strousberg, was Chairman.
This syndicate was granted a concession by
the Roumanian Chamber on October 2, 1868.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the progress of the railways,
the question soon gave rise to heated debates in
the Chamber. For example, on June 11, 1869,
a great commotion was caused there by a
charge brought against the Syndicate that it
had extended the line unduly by a ten-mile curve
at Barboschi (payment, it will be remembered,
was to be made according to the mileage).
Nevertheless, in spite of all this petty opposition,
the Prince had the satisfaction of seeing
the first section of the Roumanian railways, connecting
Bukowina and Moldavia, completed on
December 15, 1869, whilst no less than 130 miles
of much needed high roads were opened for traffic,
chiefly on the western frontier of Roumania.</p>

<p>As the payment for the railways was to be
governed by the completed mileage, the Finance
Minister instructed the Roumanian Commissary
in Berlin, Privy Councillor Ambronn, to control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
his payments by the certificates of the engineer,
countersigned by the chief of the newly created
Technical Bureau. This evoked an immediate
protest from one of the concessionaries, Dr. Strousberg,
who threatened to appeal to the law courts
against so unjustifiable a check on the honesty of
the contractors. Councillor Ambronn reported
that he felt unable to refuse payment, although
the engineers' certificates were not countersigned,
and further, that the proceeds of the bonds were
deposited, partly in cash, partly in stocks bearing
interest, at the Berlin Kassenverein. This led to
a Parliamentary inquiry into the state of the funds
entrusted to Councillor Ambronn, and later on to
a unanimous resolution by the Ministry relieving
him of his duties. Prince Charles, however, was
of the opinion that this measure would only damage
the credit of the railways, and declared his willingness
to accept the responsibility for the railway
construction which was thus thrust upon him by
the country.</p>

<p>However, a report from the special commissioner,
Herr Steege, sent to Berlin in the autumn of 1870,
placed the affair in a different light, as it was then
discovered that the money realised by the sale of the
railway bonds (35,000,000 francs) had been placed
in the Joseph Jacques Bank without the consent
of the Roumanian Government. This incorrect
procedure on the part of the Commissary placed
the Prince in a most unpleasant position; for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
though he considered it in no way desirable that
the money should be left lying idle, he had never
intended that it should be invested in a private
company, and so exposed to every fluctuation of
the market. M. Steege was therefore appointed
to relieve Councillor Ambronn of his duties in
connection with the railway funds.</p>

<p>It seemed that the climax of the railway dispute
must have been reached with December 18,
when Strousberg informed the Government that
he was neither able nor willing to pay the coupon
due on January 1, and further maintained that
this payment should be made by the State,
though, as a matter of fact, he had paid the July
coupon himself. The interest, it is true, was
guaranteed by the State, but the terms of the
concession provided that the interest should be
paid by Strousberg <em>whilst the line was in course
of construction</em>.</p>

<p>The entire weight of the blow fell on Prince
Charles; the railways were his pet idea, nay,
even his consolation, as a passage in one of his
letters to his father shows. "I have at least
done <em>something</em> for my country&mdash;I have given it a
railway!" But now even that comfort had been
taken away.</p>

<p>Prince Charles, however anxious he was at that
time to escape from his almost intolerable position
in Roumania, felt that he could not quit his
adopted country until he had procured justice for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
his people, and removed the slur which appeared
to rest upon their honesty.</p>

<p>Early in March 1871 M. Sturdza thus described
the financial situation of the Principalities. The
expenditure, but not the receipts, of the State
had increased threefold during the last thirteen
years; the public debt, which in Prussia amounted
to 2 francs a head, reached a total of 7 francs in
Roumania, whilst 34,000,000 out of the 84,000,000
francs received had to be devoted to the payment
of interest, thus leaving only 50,000,000 available
for expenditure. It was, therefore, scarcely a
matter for surprise that the Chamber should
openly testify to the general indignation felt by
the nation, when the fresh burden of the interest
on the railway bonds was thrust upon the
resources of the country. In their wrath, however,
the deputies forgot to be just, and threw the
whole blame on Prince Charles. Not a single
voice was raised to point out that the Prince himself
suffered most from the painful situation to
which dishonesty and carelessness had brought
the railways. He could not be expected to know
in detail all the requirements of such concessions.
The only just reproach which could be made against
him was the unconditional confidence which he, in
his youthful enthusiasm, had placed in Strousberg
and Ambronn, from a desire to procure the
benefits of the railway for his country as soon as
possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The attacks turned chiefly on the circumstance
that Ambronn had been for a long time in the
service of the Prince of Hohenzollern, though
this was rather a reason for excusing the Prince,
who was surely justified in employing a man
whose honest administration had already gained
the confidence of his father.</p>

<p>As a way out of the difficulty Prince Charles
thought that the State should pay the January
coupon and sue Strousberg for the amount, in
accordance with paragraph 7 of the concession.
Unfortunately the Treasury was empty, the
Chamber would never consent to such a measure,
and to raise a loan was out of the question.</p>

<p>To crown the disaster an official intimation was
received from the Prussian Government that the
coupon due must be paid by the Roumanian State,
as the bonds were only placed on the market
owing to the confidence inspired in the Roumanian
State guarantee.</p>

<p>Pressure was brought to bear on Roumania by
a Note maintaining the rights of the German
bondholders, addressed by Prince Bismarck to the
Sublime Porte as Suzerain of the Principalities.
The Strousberg affair thus threatened to become
more a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">question de force</i> than a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">question de droit</i>.
It appeared, moreover, that a lawsuit against
Strousberg was out of the question, as the bondholders,
and not the Roumanian Government,
were the injured parties. Needless to say, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
opinion of the Prussian law-officers evoked great
indignation in Roumania.</p>

<p>Eventually, on January 2, 1872, the Chamber
decided to offer the bondholders two alternatives:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) To take over the rights and obligations of
the first concession, to complete the railways in
three years with an annual grant of nine millions
towards the coupons; the payment of the last
year's interest, and the restitution of the deposit
to be obtained from Strousberg.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To transfer all their rights to the Roumanian
State, which pledged itself to pay off the
bonds (to be exchanged for State papers) in forty-nine
years' time by an annual payment of eleven
millions.</p>

<p>Three weeks later the Prince had the satisfaction
of informing his father that the vexed
question appeared to be solved at last.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You can hardly imagine what I have lived
through during the last weeks of the old year!
Excitements, anxieties, and hopes changed with
every day. Day after day passed without any result,
or any hope of solving the unfortunate railway
question: such a strain on the nerves might have
caused the strongest man to give way. At first
weeks passed before the matter reached the order
of the day, then the preliminary debates lasted
fully four days; the result was by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
certain the first two days, as the Opposition
brought all its batteries into action. I
breathed again on the evening of the fourth day,
and the city also calmed down at once from its
former feverish excitement. The agitators are
afraid that the settlement of the railway question,
which they had made a dynastic one, has robbed
them of their last dangerous weapon....</p>

<p>"The Opposition used Von Radowitz's declaration
in Constantinople&mdash;that the Emperor was
directly interested in an arrangement&mdash;with much
skill and perfidy, drawing the deduction that the
House of Hohenzollern was mixed up in this dirty
business. It is much too hackneyed and ridiculous
to be even annoyed about!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The expense of the many reforms initiated by
the Prince also contributed to the chronic want
of money. For instance, a report by M. Jepureanu
on June 9, 1874, showed the existence of a
floating debt of fifty-seven million francs, which
was out of all proportion to the resources of an
agricultural country, where a failure of the crops
occurred about once in six years. It was further
stated that of late years, in spite of all the new
taxation, the expenditure had always exceeded the
receipts.</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>January 26th, 1875</i>.</h3>

<p>"Only a few days ago I was confidently looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to the immediate future, and hoped that the
Roumanian railway system, which I had achieved
for the country after such severe struggles, would
soon be opened for traffic. I believed that this
intolerable affair, which has cost me several years
of my life, was finally settled, and looked forward
to enjoying the fruits of my labour. But no!
To-day the railways are again the disturbing
element. After great effort I had achieved
the stability and peace so necessary for the
development of the country: domestic affairs
had become consolidated, and abroad we enjoyed
respect and confidence. All this may again be
at stake.</p>

<p>"... The Berlin Company must raise a
loan of seventy-five million francs to pay the debts
incurred in construction; in so doing they want
our support, and ask for a law giving this loan
preferential rights in the annuities. This is, of
course, out of the question, as the former creditors
must always have the first claim.... We
do not conceal the seriousness of the situation, the
more so since the German Government urgently
requests us to give way to the entreaties of the
company, and so prevent a catastrophe which
would principally be felt by the shareholders. In
the event of our inability to regulate this affair
the German Government would in future be
compelled to withhold the exercise of its benevolent
interest in Roumania!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"This threat is very serious, and we foresee
its evil consequences."</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Bismarck</span>.</h3>

<p>"For several weeks we have been exclusively
occupied with the difficulties which the new loan
for the completion of our railway system causes
both here and in Berlin. Animated with a lively
wish to bring this important affair to a satisfactory
conclusion, my Government has commissioned
the Minister of Public Works, M. Th. Rosetti,
to proceed to Berlin, and to place himself in
personal communication with the railway company.</p>

<p>"I cannot conceal from your Serene Highness
that the proposals of the company, which must be
settled by constitutional methods, encounter no
small difficulties, arising from the very nature
of the affair. Nevertheless, my Government has
every wish to prepare a solution which would be
acceptable to both parties, and which could be
successfully promoted in the Chamber here. If
we may hope for the benevolent interest of your
Highness in this delicate question, I do not doubt
that it will soon be solved. M. Rosetti is able
to give the necessary information should your
Highness desire to enter more fully into the
question."</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Bismarck</span>, <i>March 1875</i>.</h3>

<p>"I return my humblest thanks to your Highness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
for the gracious letter which Minister Rosetti
has handed to me. The knowledge and personal
amiability of the latter has made a favourable
impression on all circles here, and he has brought
the negotiations to such a point that their conclusion
may be expected, provided the result here
gains the approbation of your Highness's Government.
I myself entertain the hope that such may
be the case, the more willingly since so large an
amount of German capital is placed in no other
foreign enterprise, and the solidly assured future
of the railways must exert a decisive influence on
the development of the rich resources with which
Roumania is blessed by nature. The protection
afforded to the enterprise by your Highness will
contribute materially to maintain and further
public interest in Germany for the welfare of
Roumania."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whilst these delicate negotiations were in
progress, the question of the right of Roumania to
enter into commercial treaties was brought to a
close. The intimate relations of the Principalities
to Austria-Hungary rendered it desirable that the
first treaty should be concluded with that State,
not without opposition in the Chamber, and it was
actually voted on July 10, 1875. "This international
act," the Prince wrote, "is of great
importance, as it contains the germ of Roumanian
independence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The Budget of 1876, which announced a deficit
of 30,000,000 francs, was received with a storm of
indignation, and eventually led to the fall of the
Catargiu Ministry.</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>April 26th, 1876</i>.</h3>

<p>"The excitement here is very great; there are
rumours of conspiracies and revolutions; but all
this cannot terrify me, for I go straight ahead and
do my duty. The condition of our finances, and
the serious situation in the East, does, however,
make me anxious. The former is the consequence
of the latter; for months no money has come into
the country, and trade is completely at a standstill.
All our securities have fallen, railway and
customs returns have decreased, farmers cannot
pay, and taxes are hard to collect. Nevertheless,
the engine of State must not be allowed to stop,
and we must pay the interest on our debts in
order to maintain our credit! All this has
materially affected our finances, which were in a
satisfactory state."</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <small>THE SAME</small>, <i>December 14th, 1876</i>.</h3>

<p>"Neither the approach of the war, nor the
probable passage of foreign troops makes me really
anxious: I am troubled rather by the comfortless
state of our finances, which have reached a stage
impregnated with danger for the immediate
future. The State can only maintain its credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
at the greatest sacrifice, by paying the coupons
of the foreign debt with the little money remaining
in the country, and in addition it must raise
sufficient to pay the army.</p>

<p>"Under these circumstances only a well-assured
peace, or a war, can be of any assistance; a long
extension of this uncertainty will be our ruin!"</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <small>THE SAME</small>, <i>January 20th, 1877</i>.</h3>

<p>"The money famine increases daily, and I
cannot see how we are to be helped out of our
difficulty. Only the most necessary payments are
made. Even the Civil List has not been paid
for months."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The longed-for war, bringing with it the
independence of Roumania, arrived at last, and
with it came perhaps the lowest point touched by
Roumanian finance. All payments were stopped
both at home and abroad, every tax was doubled,
and 30,000,000 francs of paper money were issued
on the security of the Crown lands, to be redeemed
at 10 per cent. above par. Such were the
sacrifices which the Roumanian nation offered at
the shrine of patriotism and independence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE JEWISH QUESTION</h3>


<p class="noind">The first years of Prince Charles's rule were overcast
by the shadow thrown by that source of
constant trouble in Eastern Europe, the Jewish
Question, and by the pro-Semitic agitation in the
Western Press. The bulk of the Jewish population
of Roumania was settled in the Province of
Moldavia, where it held mortgages on the greater
part of the estates. In addition to this, as
"universal providers" they almost monopolised
the trade in spirits, whilst the bulk of the retail
trade also lay in their hands. In times of famine
and scarcity they were always ready to lend money
at exorbitant rates to the heedless landowner and
ignorant peasant, and thus acquired a hold over
them which could not be shaken off. The bitter
hatred with which the Moldavian population
regarded their oppressors, and the violence caused
by that feeling, were powerless to prevent the
constant immigration of Jews from Poland and
Southern Russia, where they experienced a far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
harder lot than that which awaited them in
Roumania. That the anti-Semitic feeling was not
wholly unjustifiable is shown by the opinion of
M. Desjardins, who had ample opportunity of
learning the rights and wrongs of the case. The
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i> declared that the Jews were not
only aliens and strangers in Roumania by their
language, religion, and customs, but that they
actually desired to remain so. They refused to
send their children to the Roumanian schools,
though entitled to do so free of expense, and
besides monopolising the whole retail trade of
Moldavia, they exerted a most evil influence on
the progress of the country by their usury. The
peasant was forced to pay up to fifty per cent. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per
mensem</i> on loans, as there were no other means of
raising money in times of scarcity. The Moldavian
Jew was dirty and utterly neglected, and could
not from any point of view be considered a desirable
acquisition to the State.</p>

<p>The Jews of Eastern Europe in general, and of
Roumania in particular, have no intention, and,
for the matter of that, no inclination to stoop to
handicraft or manufacture. The quicker methods
of getting money appeal to them more; and
they are perfectly content to live on the needs
and necessities of the original inhabitants of the
land, though at the same time they bitterly resent
the feeling with which they and their methods of
money-making are regarded. The first outbursts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of racial hatred during Prince Charles's reign
proved too strong for the good intentions of the
Government, nor was it to be expected that the
Roumanian legislature would grant the alien race
further rights or further liberty than Russia or
even Austria felt inclined to do.</p>

<p>Crémieux, the well-known politician and founder
of the <i>Alliance Israélite</i>, interviewed the Prince
on June 14, 1866, to try to obtain an alteration
in the laws enabling Jews to hold land in
Roumania, and, acting on the time-honoured
maxim of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">do ut des</i>, offered in return for this
privilege a loan of £1,000,000 at a low rate of
interest. The Prince informed him that the
Government had already remembered the condition
of the Jews in the draft of the Constitution,
since the following paragraphs had been inserted:
"Creed is no impediment to naturalisation in
Roumania," and "So far as the Jews at present
domiciled in Roumania are concerned, a special
law will provide for their gradual admission as
naturalised citizens." However, as soon as these
proposals were laid before the Chamber, a wave
of dissent swept over Moldavia, where the anti-dynastic
party sought to create trouble by
appealing to racial hatred. They succeeded only
too well, for a riotous mob destroyed the recently
completed synagogue at Bucharest in June 1866.
The obnoxious paragraphs of the Constitution
were withdrawn owing to the representations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the Jews themselves, who feared further excesses,
if the Government persisted in them. The foreign
Press eagerly seized the opportunity for spreading
the report that, owing to the weakness of the
Government, the paragraphs had been withdrawn
in obedience to the wishes of the mob. The
liberally minded Prince, to show his displeasure at
the action of a section of the populace, and at the
same time to prove his toleration in matters of
religion, subscribed 6,000 ducats from his own
purse for the restoration of the wrecked synagogue,
but at the same time the Chamber, by passing the
clause: "Only Christians can become Roumanian
citizens," denied the Jews the possession of any
political rights.</p>

<p>In April 1867 the Minister of the Interior,
J. Bratianu, addressed a circular to all prefects,
ordering them to proceed against all "vagabonds"
in their districts; as, owing to the abolition of
passes, the number of paupers had increased to
such an extent as to add seriously to the already
enormous difficulties of the Government in feeding
the starving inhabitants. England, France, and
Austria protested vigorously against this measure,
which was chiefly directed against immigrant
Jews, and the Emperor Napoleon addressed the
following telegram to the Prince on this subject:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I must not leave your Highness in ignorance
of the public feeling created here by the persecutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of which the Jews of Moldavia are said to
be the victims. I cannot believe that the
enlightened Government of your Highness
authorises measures so opposed to humanity and
civilisation.</p>

<p class="sig">
"NAPOLEON."
</p></blockquote>

<p>To which the Prince replied at once:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your Majesty may rest assured that I am not
less solicitous for the Jewish inhabitants than
your Majesty. The measures which the Government
has thought necessary to take are not
exceptional, and are a matter of common law. I
shall, moreover, institute a severe inquiry to ascertain
whether the subaltern officials have exceeded
their instructions. Those guilty will be punished
with all the rigour of the law.</p>

<p class="sig">
"CHARLES."
</p></blockquote>

<p>All the laws against the Jews which had been
passed in Moldavia since 1804 were published in
the official <cite>Moniteur</cite> on May 28, 1867, to
counteract the prejudice which the recent circular
had created. It was thus made clear that
Jews had always been prohibited from becoming
tenants of farms, public-houses, and drinking-booths;
and that the sole motive of the Ministerial
Circular was to remind the prefects of the existence
of these regulations, which had been allowed to
fall somewhat into abeyance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Moses Montefiore, the well-known British
merchant and philanthropist, who was touring
through Roumania to investigate personally the
condition of the Jews, was presented to the Prince
by the British Consul on August 25, 1867. Sir
Moses was able to inform his Highness that he
could not trace any persecution of the Jews in
Wallachia, and on his return to England declared,
through the Press, that the situation of his
brethren in Roumania had been painted in
colours far too dark, and that there could be no
question of their ill-treatment, as both the Prince
and his Ministers were very tolerant, and had
given him every assistance in eliciting the
truth.</p>

<p>The Chamber, however, continued to persist in
anti-Semitic legislation, and a "free and independent
party" of thirty-three Moldavians introduced
a measure on March 17, 1868, which contained
the following provisions: "Jews may only settle
in urban districts by permission of the town
council, but on no condition, and for no length of
time, in the rural districts.</p>

<p>"They are not allowed to possess real property
in towns or in the country. Sales and purchases
in their favour are null and void.</p>

<p>"They are also forbidden to become tenants
of farms, vineyards, public-houses, hotels, kilns,
bridges, &amp;c., or to manage the same, and neither
the State nor Communalities are to entrust them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with contracts.... They are not to sell food or
liquor to Christians, but only to Jews." Bratianu,
whom the foreign Semitic Press hounded down as
a persecutor of the Jews, opposed this motion with
the greatest vigour, and openly broke with its
proposers. He was in consequence overwhelmed
with contumely and reproaches, and was on
one occasion stoned by anti-Semitic mobs in
Moldavia.</p>

<p>The Jewish Question was ably summed up by
Prince Charles Anthony in a letter to his son,
received on May 21, 1868.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Jewish question has reached a stage
which attracts the rapt attention of the whole of
Europe. It is a most unfortunate episode in the
otherwise peaceful development of Roumanian
internal economy, and is at the same time a great
danger to the dynasty. I have already pointed
out that all Jewish affairs are a '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noli me tangere</i>.'
This fact is a symptom of European weakness;
but, since it is a fact, it must be accepted; nothing
can be done, as the whole Press of Europe is
controlled by the Jewish financial powers. In one
word, the moneyed Judaism is a Great Power,
whose favour may have the most advantageous
effect, but whose opposition is dangerous. From
every side, from all corners and ends of the earth,
a cry of horror arose in unison about the Bakau
incident, and nothing, not even the official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
<em>dementia</em>, could mitigate or alleviate the impression
created by these incidents. It seems to me that
Bratianu has not shown sufficient energy in this
question, and is inclined to stake too much on one
card!"...</p>

<p>"Innumerable petitions have reached me from
all parts imploring my support in this unfortunate
Jewish affair, especially from the <i>Alliance Israélite</i>
(Crémieux); Paris has made the most noise about
it. This cannot be altered; and you have gained
nothing but increased experience."</p></blockquote>

<p>Advice on this difficult question was also
tendered from a quarter whence it was least
expected. Fuad Pacha pointed out to the Roumanian
agent in Constantinople that the Principalities
ought to take Turkey as an example of
tolerance in matters of religion, for at Constantinople
one might see Jews sitting side by side with
Mohammedans and Christians in the Council of
State!</p>

<p>On September 12, 1869, Prince Charles received
a deputation of Jews on the occasion of his stay
in Vienna. In reply to their representations on
behalf of their brethren in Roumania, Prince
Charles declared that the alleged persecution only
existed in the imagination of agitators, and that
the condition of the Roumanian Jews was by no
means so miserable and abject as the European
Press was ready and anxious to believe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time, the anti-Semitic element in
the Chamber sought to overthrow the Ghika
Ministry by accusing it of a tendency to favour
the Jews. The Minister of the Interior, Cogalniceanu,
it appeared, had recommended two Delegates
of the <i>Alliance Israélite</i> to the prefects of the
districts, in order that they might have every
opportunity of knowing the country and its
inhabitants. It was also proved by statistics that
the number of Jews in Moldavia was steadily
increasing, whilst the Roumanians were being
forced back by this constant stream of immigration.
The measure of their success and increasing influence
was in direct proportion to the corresponding
weakness and poverty of the Christian tillers of
the soil. Cogalniceanu, however, showed that the
Jews were not favoured at the expense of the
Roumanians, and that the Government had no
means of preventing Jewish immigration from
Russia or Galicia. He also pointed out that he
had proposed to allow the Jews to settle near
the delta of the Danube; but, as that proposal
had been negatived, he could only suggest
that the Chamber should formulate some other
measure.</p>

<p>Nearly three years later (May 1872) a petition
from the Jews of Eastern Prussia was laid before
the German Reichstag, praying that Germany
would use its influence in putting a stop to the
persecution of Jews in Roumania. Dr. Miquel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
pointed out that, although he sympathised deeply
with the sufferers, it was necessary to proceed with
caution, as otherwise their situation might become
even worse, for no Government was ever so weak
as that of Roumania, and continual exhortations
would only incite the inhabitants to further outrages,
which might eventually lead to animosity
against their German Prince. Von Bunsen
supported Miquel's view and showed that no persecutions
had taken place between 1866 and 1872.
Eventually a resolution was carried, recognising
the previous efforts on behalf of the Jews, and
requesting the Chancellor to do everything
possible to prevent the recurrence of such incidents
in the future.</p>

<p>England also took up the cudgels on behalf of
the Jews, and proposed to the various guaranteeing
Powers to comply with the 46th Article of the
Treaty of Paris, and grant political rights to the
Jews. Prince Gortchakoff came to the assistance
of Roumania, and reminded the Western
Powers that it was impossible to compare the
Jews of the Orient with those of the West.
Russia had no intention of interfering in the
domestic affairs of another State, though she would
unite with the Powers in representing the matter
to the Roumanian Government. He therefore
advised England to communicate direct with the
Roumanian Government before invoking the aid of
the other Powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>A letter from the Prince to his father contained
the following passage about this difficulty:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My only fear is lest the Jews<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> should continue
to agitate and petition the guaranteeing
Powers for the concession of political rights to
their brethren here, until the Powers at last
comply with their wish, and force our hand. This
would lead to the overthrow of the present, or,
indeed, any other Ministry.</p>

<p>"A few months ago the Jews here received
some sympathy from certain circles, but since they
have raised such a cry throughout Europe, and
since the Jewish Press in every State has attacked
this country in so unworthy a manner with the
object of forcing the equality of the Jews upon us,
the latter have nothing to expect here for the
present...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another letter of Prince Charles also refers to
this point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The newspapers again accuse us of persecuting
the Jews, because the recent licensing law
forbids a Jew to keep a public-house in a village.
This is a reasonable measure; and we are determined
to repel any representations or interventions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in this matter. One must know the villages of
Moldavia to be able to judge the noxious influence
exerted on the rural population by the Jew
with his adulterated brandy. In Poland and
Hungary the Jew is to this day forbidden to keep
a village public-house&mdash;and very rightly too! On
the other hand, it is a pity that Roumania has
excluded Jews from holding licences for the sale
of tobacco, as they will now become the most
arrant smugglers."</p></blockquote>

<p>Russia replied to the Note, addressed by
England to the Great Powers, referring to the
persecution of the Moldavian Jews, with a circular
to its representatives abroad directing them
to defend the Roumanian measures.</p>

<p>The struggle so briefly touched upon in these
pages affected the welfare of Roumania in
its young days very keenly, as the great Jewish
capitalists supported the demands of the Jewish
population for the franchise by refusing to aid the
young State in its financial troubles. Incalculable
harm was done by the Press in giving a too-ready
credence to the alarming reports of wholesale
expulsion of Jewish families from Roumania and
the confiscation of their property. The anti-Roumanian
feeling thus caused in England,
France, and in part of Germany was for many
years a serious stumbling-block to the development
of the Danube Principalities.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>PEACEFUL DEVELOPMENT</h3>


<p class="noind">The day selected by the Prince and Princess
of Roumania for the commencement of their
tour through Moldavia&mdash;April 20, 1871&mdash;was one
of good omen for the result of that journey.
Prince Charles was anxious to reinstate the close
and intimate relations which had existed between
him and his people before the recent agitation,
as well as to give the lie to the calumny that he
no longer took an interest in his subjects. The
Princess, too, was eager to become more closely
acquainted with the beauties of her new country
under her husband's guidance. Unfortunately
the pleasure of the trip was marred by the constant
downpour of rain, which laid half of Jassy
under water. But the Prince and Princess did
not allow the weather to interfere with their
plans, and succeeded in visiting every noteworthy
place or institution. At their departure from the
Moldavian capital, as on their arrival, they
received a most enthusiastic ovation, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Prince Charles replied that the heartiness of their
welcome everywhere had convinced him that the
lately dissolved Chamber had in no way expressed
the sentiments of the nation. The memory of the
heartfelt sympathy accorded to the dynasty in
Jassy had, he added, given him fresh courage and
energy to devote to the high duties entrusted to
him by the nation.</p>

<p>Prince Charles expressed the same views to the
Ministry on his return to Bucharest, and informed
them that he had given up the thought of abdication,
as his tour through Moldavia had satisfied
him that the nation would be loyal to the Sovereign
they had elected, whilst condemning the
revolutionary aims which had been the source of
the recent trouble. The marvellous change which
had taken place in the Roumanian situation in the
short space of five weeks did not fail of prompt
recognition abroad. The Austrian Ambassador at
Constantinople remarked: "If Prince Charles
succeeds in managing Roumania with his own
resources, and in rendering it governable, it will
be the greatest <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de force</i> I have witnessed in
my diplomatic career of more than half a century.
It will be nothing less than a conjuring trick!"</p>

<p>Prince Charles thus described the surprising
change of situation between March 22 and May 22:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Then there were revolts in the streets, breaking
of windows, and an approaching abdication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Now there is rejoicing throughout the country,
ovation after ovation, and a celebration of the
anniversary of my accession in a more hearty
and universal fashion than I have been accustomed
to for a long time. Everything that was
possible has been done to wipe out the memory of
our bitter experiences of last winter, alike during
our tour through Moldavia and on our return and
on May 22....</p>

<p>"Moldavia has recently been the arena of
anarchical and separatist intrigues so wide in extent
that no great success could be expected at the
recent elections, the more so as a rumour had been
spread throughout Moldavia that I had decided
to turn my back on the country very shortly.
Our tour effected a complete change. Towns
like Galatz and Fokschani, which have sent anti-dynastic
Deputies to the Chamber for four years
in succession to advocate my deposition, have now
elected men who openly declared themselves to be
on the side of my dynasty during the most critical
period. The elections throughout the country
have resulted satisfactorily, and my Ministry can
count upon a secure majority.... Tell voted
against a foreign prince in 1866, as he was of
opinion that such a ruler could neither become
intimately acquainted with the country, nor would
enjoy the same language or religion.... He informed
me on entering the Ministry that no Prince
had ever known the country better or respected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the Church so much as I had done.... He
says: 'I think more of the happiness of the
country than of its liberties!'...</p>

<p>"General Solomon and Colonels Slaniceanu,
Lupu, and Sefcari are thorough soldiers, who were
all at their posts in the hour of danger and did
their duty loyally. The army, moreover, behaved
excellently at the critical time, which gave me
great pleasure, as I have always given it special
attention.</p>

<p>"... I should like to be able to lengthen
every day, for none suffices for my continuous
work. Everything that is performed in silence
by the chiefs of departments in other countries is
here laid before me; no decision is arrived at
without my being consulted. Every one wants
an audience of the Prince to lay a grievance
before him. But the more work I have the better
I like it, and I by no means wish to complain."</p></blockquote>

<p>Owing to the sudden illness of the Grand
Vizier, Ali Pacha, through overwork, and the prevailing
centralisation of the Turkish Government,
all affairs of State came to a standstill for the
time being. The Sultan refused to appoint a substitute,
and Ali Pacha refused to resign: "I shall
die, if needs be, but I shall die as Grand Vizier!"</p>

<p>The Prince and Princess, with their little
daughter, sought protection from the climate of
Cotroceni in the cloister of Sinaja on August 2.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
The arrangements made for them were extremely
primitive: the small whitewashed rooms, or rather
cells, were connected only by a wooden verandah
on the inside of the building, round the inner
court of the cloister. The magnificent view over
the mountain scenery, however, amply compensated
for the lack of comfort; whilst a heavy
thunderstorm, with brilliant flashes of lightning,
cleared and cooled the atmosphere shortly after
their arrival. The weather that followed left
nothing to be desired, and the Prince spent the
greater portion of each day in the company of
his wife and daughter in the glorious Carpathian
woods under a cloudless sky. The Princess of
Wied arrived at Sinaja on August 31 to take part
in the festivities of the first birthday of the little
Princess Marie, who, as her father reported with
joy, "has already two teeth, and will soon be
able to run about."</p>

<p>Almost daily some expedition or picnic in the
woods was arranged, especially at that spot in
the valley of the Pelesch where Prince Charles
thought of building a summer residence. This
plan had, however, to be given up, as the situation
of the proposed house was too much exposed to
the violent winds which swept down the valley.</p>

<p>These happy days came to an end, only too soon,
when on September 11 the Prince returned to
Cotroceni, followed two days later by the remainder
of the family. The Princess of Wied was forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to commence her journey home on October 28.
The Prince and Princess accompanied her a short
distance on the Giurgiu line. Prince Charles
Anthony expressed his great joy at the favourable
impression which the Princess's mother had
formed of their surroundings in Bucharest. "Her
impressions are generally favourable and, best of
all, she has gained an insight into your home
life, which could not be happier. That is of the
greatest comfort to us, since other circumstances
remain unchanged.... Moreover, Princess Wied
is satisfied with the social elements, and has
everywhere found receptivity for what is nobler
and better; a firm mortar alone is wanted to
prevent the good from dissolving and the evil
from working to the surface...."</p>

<p>Prince Charles replied the same day: "Elisabeth
has created her own sphere of action; she frequently
visits the schools and communicates the remarks
and observations made whilst the instruction is
going on personally to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conseil permanent de
l'instruction publique</i>. By this method she has
already succeeded in introducing several minor
improvements; in addition to this, she is translating
some school-books for children into Roumanian,
with the aid of some young ladies; and once a
week she presides over the Society for the Poor,
which has done good work since its institution a
year ago.... We are all well. Little Marie is full
of life, and runs from room to room. When I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
a minute to spare, I play with her. The dear
child is my greatest joy!"</p>

<p>Prince Charles and his family decided to
celebrate the Christmas festivities of 1871 according
to the Eastern calendar, on December 24
(January 5). Prince Charles Anthony's Christmas
letter contained the following interesting allusion
to German affairs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the whole everything is satisfactory in
Germany. The Prussian officers sent to Württemberg
and Baden find it difficult to grasp the
situation of South Germany; but all is satisfactory,
since necessity knows no law. Manteuffel
plays a great part in France, and is endeavouring
to traverse Bismarck's plans and intentions. But
it is really of no importance; everything succeeds
with us. Both Military Cabinet and Government
of State go their own way, and yet finally
effect a junction, because the National-Prussian
principle outweighs all else.</p>

<p>"May Thiers and the Republic long steer
France! any so-called dynastic revolution would
cause a war with Germany&mdash;not that we fear one,
but we need peace and development."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Chambers passed a law on January 5 by
which Roumania undertook to pay the coupons
commencing from January 1, 1872, and all that
remained to end the matter was the consent of
the Berlin Syndicate to the proposed compromise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>On January 28, 1872, Prince Charles was able to
inform his father that the unfortunate dispute
about the railways had at last been settled:
"A telegram has just been received from Berlin
informing us that the shareholders have accepted
the first part of the law; you can imagine our
delight! The history of this suffering has now
reached its end&mdash;thirteen months of anxiety,
excitement, and fears, form a long episode!"</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>.</h3>

<p>"My chief news to-day is that the condition
of Elisabeth's health renders a journey to the
South an absolute necessity; she has never
quite recovered from the violent attacks of fever
of last summer, and in spite of all precautions
has recently been ill again; this might lead to
serious consequences if often repeated. Since
change of air is the only really effective remedy,
she will go to Italy, and meet her Nassau relatives
and Therese of Oldenburg in Rome before Easter.
Should the climate there not suit her, she will go
on to Naples. The two months' separation, which
lies before us, is indeed very hard, the harder for
Elisabeth, since she must part with both husband
and child! It is satisfactory for me to know that
she will meet relations in Rome, whom she will be
very glad to see again. I must submit to the
inevitable; but I shall feel my solitude very much.</p>

<p>"We shall then spend the whole summer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Sinaja, where we shall be more comfortable this
time than we were last year. Abegg is at present
negotiating the purchase of some meadow and
wood lands so that we can build a country house
on our own estate, and have a refuge in the
healthy mountain air from the fevers of the
marshes....</p>

<p>"The following incident will show you the anti-German
feeling here: The Court of Appeal has
acquitted the rioters of the 10th-22nd March for
want of evidence. Costa-Foru in consequence
demanded the removal of the judges, but I refused
my consent, to avoid further unpleasantness. He
then laid a decree before me, which made the
President of the Court responsible for the acquittal
and transferred him as a punishment; this I signed.
The result of this measure was the resignation of a
large number of the best judges both of the first
and second instance, a demonstration which has
caused great excitement and has been received
with satisfaction. The gentry in question are considered
as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">victimes de la Prusse</i>, and only a few
have the courage to agree with Costa-Foru. This
is, of course, water to the opposition mill, and the
affair is exploited in every kind of way...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a long letter, received March 8, 1872, Prince
Charles Anthony minutely discussed the Prussian
and Roumanian views about the recently settled
railway dispute, and devoted particular attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the attitude of Bismarck and the Imperial
Government.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not believe that the writer of the reports
you forwarded to me can take an active share in
politics, since he gives so free a rein to his dislike
towards Bismarck and Radowitz.</p>

<p>"The German Empire to-day is a given factor,
which the practical politician is forced to take into
consideration. If you look back upon the scenes
which took place nearly a year ago in Bucharest on
the occasion of the Emperor's birthday, you cannot
expect that Germany should meet the Roumanian
population with much sympathy. Such incidents
have a lasting and estranging influence. Moreover,
the continual demonstration of the Roumanians in
favour of France cannot but displease Germany,
who has lost many thousands of her best sons in
a war which was forced upon her against her will.</p>

<p>"I am no blind eulogist of Bismarck, but he is
indispensable to Germany and Prussia, and aims
solely at great ends and means.</p>

<p>"He steps courageously over every bound; just
as he passed over us in the Spanish question, he
has now proved the correctness of his views and
his courage in the retirement of Mühler, and in
insisting on the School Inspections Bill, which
were both fundamentally <em>opposed</em> to the King's
wish and opinion. It is easy to understand that he
must neglect you in striving for great political aims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not <em>because</em> you are a Hohenzollern, but
<em>in spite</em> of your being one, that no consideration
could be paid to your name and race in the recent
solution of the railway question.</p>

<p>"I am convinced that, now that Roumania has
regained her international position with glory, the
relations with the German Empire will take a more
peaceful form. At all events, the advances lie on
the shoulders of the smaller and weaker State:
that is the ordinary course of events in politics.</p>

<p>"For that reason I dislike the following sentence
in the report you sent me: 'Because certain
capitalists are pleased to put their money into an
industrial speculation, is it necessary that it
should become a matter for the two Governments?
If this principle is admitted, where will it lead?'</p>

<p>"The participation, therefore, in a loan guaranteed
by the State is called an 'industrial speculation'!
Germany, accordingly, is peaceably to allow her
subjects to suffer loss through the Roumanian
State, and if she complains about such treatment,
where should the complaint be addressed if not to
the State, that is the Government, which does not
act in accordance with its pledges? On the other
hand, one might well ask: 'If this principle is
admitted, where will it lead?...'</p>

<p>"The importance of the names connected with the
Strousberg Syndicate was by no means the reason
for the decided steps that were taken in Berlin. The
action was rather due to consideration for the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
thousands of smaller men, who had confidently
invested in the Roumanian bonds; the high rate
of interest, it is true, was the chief inducement,
but nobody imagined that his money was invested
in a dishonest business.</p>

<p>"I now come to the end of this long letter, in
which I have spoken my mind so freely, but in
which I hope you will only recognise a proof of
my affectionate sincerity. I make no claim to be
infallible, but I should like to impress upon you that
the Teuton element to-day possesses the greatest
vitality and the richest future, and that Roumania
can only remain the master of her own future by
a sensible union with it. Let society, the Press,
and the general instinct of the nation be anti-German
if they will&mdash;they must not, if they intend
to put their feelings into practice, throw down the
gage to the Teuton spirit."</p></blockquote>

<p>Princess Elisabeth was forced to tear herself
away from her husband and daughter on March 12,
to seek health under the cloudless sky of Italy.</p>

<p>At Trieste the Princess of Hohenzollern was
awaiting her arrival in order to accompany her to
Rome, and, later on, to Naples, where the King
and Queen of Denmark, and the Prince and
Princess of Wales, with other Royal personages,
were spending the Spring. The Prince of Wales
discussed politics earnestly with Princess Elisabeth,
and asked with which side Roumania would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
ranged in the event of a war. The Princess
quickly replied: "With the strongest, of
course!"</p>

<p>A very plain and straightforward letter was
received from Prince Bismarck on April 25, 1872, in
reply to an explanation which Prince Charles had
sent him on the railway question.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your Highness can have no cause to doubt
my devotion to your person. I am sincerely
pleased that your Highness has reason to look
towards the future with greater confidence and a
more joyful assurance. My former respectful
letters will have shown your Highness how highly
I rate the difficulties of your position, and I hope
that your present hopes will not be disappointed.</p>

<p>"In the railway crisis, which is now, we hope, so
fortunately ended, the Government of his Majesty
could adopt no other attitude than that of guarding
the rights and interests of German subjects.
The appeal to the suzerain power of the Porte,
which your Highness complains of, was necessary
on account of the position of these German interests
and the principles of international law; and
only the blindness of the parties in Roumania
could see in it any damage to the autonomy of the
country as established by the conventions."</p></blockquote>

<p>After alluding to the anti-German demonstrations
in 1871 and the acquittal of the rioters of
March 22, Bismarck continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is therefore a surprise to us to learn that,
as your Highness remarks, the hope is cherished
in Roumania that the autonomy may be extended
by the mediation of Germany, and new rights
acquired, and that by this means friendly relations
may be re-established. I am afraid that
public opinion in Germany will scarcely appreciate
the reconquest of the favour of the Roumanian
nation, since we may say to ourselves that we have
neither desired nor brought about its loss. Your
Highness knows how unconditionally you may
reckon on the good will of H. M. the Emperor
and King and of his Government, and that we
all entertain the best wishes for the prosperity
and welfare of your country; but at the same time
your Highness has too clear an insight into the
wants of your country not to recognise that the
conditions of that prosperity and that welfare
must be sought in the development of its internal
politics, and in the faithful fulfilment of the
obligations it has undertaken, and that the influence
exerted in Europe by the German Empire
may be of great use to the Roumanian nation, if
the latter in any way responds to, or even acknowledges,
the friendly feeling for Roumania which
still exists here."</p></blockquote>


<h3><i>From the</i> <span class="smcap">German Crown Prince</span>.</h3>

<p>"My best thanks for the photographs; your
child must have charming and interesting features:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
she reminds one of both the families to which
her parents belong! The surroundings amused
us, and we greatly admired Elisabeth in the
national costume. In spite of photographs, however,
I can hardly imagine my old friend Charles
as a married man and father with a child on his
arm! It is an indescribable happiness to be a father,
and I can only too readily imagine how you spend
every free hour in the society of your child, and
that you found the little mite the only consolation
for her mother's absence during your first separation....</p>

<p>"When I reflect on the course of events in
Germany, since the Düppel assault first attracted
the attention of the world to us Prussians,
it always seems to me as though I had listened
with rapt attention to a long history lesson&mdash;that
I was called to witness the reality appears a
marvel. May our people in future preserve the
same becoming earnestness and humility which up
to now they have not laid aside in spite of all their
successes! So long as that feeling is not abandoned
we show ourselves worthy of the deeds we have
witnessed.</p>

<p>"You will remember that the thought of a
reconstitution of the Empire as the finishing
touch in the work of German unity has always
occupied me, and been among my sincerest wishes;
truly, my aim was directed at a peaceable and
bloodless achievement of this fact, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the same object might have been reached without
a war. But these are idle questions which can no
longer be considered: we have rather to look to a
systematic and thorough completion of the Empire,
the external form of which is perhaps attained,
but many a year must pass before its southern
component parts have quite found their place in
the new building. The peoples, especially that
portion which took active part in the war, are far
more favourable to the new situation than the
Cabinets; I shall therefore not be at all surprised
if the next few years bring us some most disagreeable
conflicts of aim. The peculiarities of
each separate country forming the Empire will
always be respected and interference with their
internal affairs must be avoided; I therefore do
not at all like the expression 'a uniform State.'
But it is for that very reason that earnest pains
must be taken that perfect unity may be shown in
military, legal, and foreign-political fields, and that
these elements may become more and more firmly
welded together.</p>

<p>"To my joy our neighbour States do not appear
to view our union with unfavourable eyes, and
that is in itself a great deal&mdash;we shall certainly not
be loved by any of them. The revengeful feeling
of France is only natural and explicable, though
much water will flow between the banks of the
Rhine before that feeling will issue in act....</p>

<p>"You would hardly recognise my children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
again. William<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> is growing and is hard at work.
Henry has become stronger than he was. Charlotte
does not seem to grow at all, yet she is pretty,
like her fair-haired sister. The youngest you do
not know at all&mdash;they are already very well-developed
little atoms mentally."</p>

<p>Princess Elisabeth reached Genoa on her way
home to Bucharest on April 30. She had left
Naples only a few days before a terrible eruption
of Vesuvius, accompanied with earthquakes, which
caused the death of some two hundred persons.
At Vienna the Princess was visited by the Emperor
of Austria, Count Andrassy, and a number of her
relations. Prince Charles met the Princess near
Orschowa and was delighted to find her completely
restored to health. Their entry into Bucharest
was greeted in every way as heartily as on their
return from Germany in 1869. The streets of
the capital were so densely packed by a most
enthusiastic multitude that the carriage could
only proceed at a walk.</p>

<p>The following letter from the German Emperor
was brought by M. Mavrogheni:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">

"<span class="smcap">My Dearest Cousin</span>,&mdash;
</p>

<p>"I have to thank you for two letters, one for
March 22 handed me by your father, and the
other by the bearer of this letter. Let me first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
thank you heartily for your loyal wishes on
my birthday; since recent events took place
that day has certainly gained more prominence
than formerly, but it also reminds us to return
thanks to Him who set us so unexpected a task,
and who gave us strength to execute it. The
feelings expressed to me on March 22 are in this
respect of value and joy to me, since it is assuredly
of God's mercy that one is selected to execute His
will on earth on behalf of a nation and its army.</p>

<p>"Your last letter gave me an occasion only
yesterday to speak with your Minister, as I am
suffering from an injured knee and cannot dress
myself well. We discussed the Strousberg affair,
which appears to be favourably settled on the
whole, but which has had a very susceptible and
aggravating effect at times. The Jewish question
was then discussed. It is a hard task to have to
side with a race of men whose character I know
only too well from the Russian Poles. Although
in the most examples the guilt of the Jews,
according to your own Government's showing,
was not at all as heinous as it appeared at first,
still the punishment was severe, and some show of
mercy would certainly be advisable; on the other
hand, it must be regretted that the repression of
riots and Jew-baiting was not employed quickly
or effectually enough. This, of course, again
creates the impression abroad that the internal
politics of Roumania are not yet stable, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
will never eradicate this impression until you have
created a well-organised and disciplined army, able
to enforce obedience to the orders of the Government,
not by strength of numbers, but by quality.
I expressed this opinion years ago to you through
Colonel Krenski, and I regret that you still do
not grasp this point&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, that you still place more
value on the quantity of your forces than in their
quality.</p>

<p>"I realise the difficulty of your task, but it is
absolutely necessary if Europe is to gain confidence
in your Government through the prevalence
of order and security in Roumania.</p>

<p>"I am indeed sorry that your wife's health
made a separation necessary, but it was certainly
high time to overcome the fever: nothing undermines
the health more than lingering ill-health;
I therefore hope the best from the Princess's
change of air!</p>

<p>"Farewell, and preserve a friendly memory of
your very sincere Cousin,</p>

<p class="sig">
"WILLIAM."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Roumanian Court moved to Sinaja on
May 29, 1872, where the fresh mountain air completely
restored the Prince and his family to
robust health. The Prince wrote the following
description of a great bear-hunt to his father:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I went bear-hunting a week ago. Three
hundred beaters with drums and trumpets, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
sound of which re-echoed tenfold in the rocky
valleys, and close on thirty hunters, who completed
a circle of several miles, and secured our
quarry. Two drives were arranged, each of which
lasted from two and a half to three hours.</p>

<p>"After leaving Sinaja about five o'clock I
climbed the first summit, Furnica, which I reached
at seven. It was just here that a large she-bear
had killed several sheep three days before, and
devoured them at a short distance from the
shepherds, who looked on trembling. I posted
myself at this point behind a rock overlooking two
deep ravines. The drive then began, accompanied
by the penetrating cries of the beaters, who
descended the slopes on all sides in an unbroken
chain. Suddenly the sky clouded over and a
terrible storm broke, so that you could not see ten
paces before you. As nothing was to be seen after
a wait of two hours we sought refuge in a hut; in
a short space of time the weather cleared up,
and the pretty Prachova valley lay at our feet
bathed in the brightest sunshine.</p>

<p>"This change in the weather encouraged
Elisabeth and her ladies to leave Pojani Zapului,
whither she had driven that morning, and proceed
to meet me with the luncheon. After I had sat
three hours in the hut waiting for the bear, or
rather the luncheon, the latter arrived about noon,
and we sat down to it together on a greensward;
the hunters and beaters, the Dorobanzi and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
horses camped round about us. All the groups
were indescribably picturesque; in the background
the bare rock summits of the Kairaman, Omul,
&amp;c., appeared like veritable ghosts. At two
o'clock we again descended to Pojana Zapului, a
little village at the entrance of the <i>valea babei</i>,
the rendezvous of the bears. I separated from
Elisabeth here, and climbed down into this
haunted valley, where we came across a primeval
wood. Again I found a position which overlooked
two ravines. The greatest bear-hunter of the
neighbourhood was close to me, and assured me
that I should catch sight of some bears. I waited
patiently for close on three hours behind a decayed
tree; the cries of the beaters had long since died
away, single shots were heard in the distance, a
portion of the beaters had finished their task, and
still nothing was to be seen. I laid my rifle aside
discontentedly, but the huntsman whispered to
me to have patience for another half-hour. I took
up my rifle, and ten minutes had barely sped
when I heard a loud rustling, stones rolled down
the sides of the ravine, and two young bears
crossed our field of sight, and one after the other
descended the slope, breaking the rotten boughs
with their broad paws. The distance was not
great, and I could easily have put a bullet into
one of them if boughs and tree-trunks had not
impeded my aim. I therefore quitted my position,
and climbed down a little way to get a free field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of fire, but the huntsman had in the meantime
reached the edge of the ravine and killed one of
the bears with his first shot; the other would
certainly not have escaped him if he had had a
double-barrelled rifle. The great excitement now
commenced, as the she-bear, which had already
been fired on by the beaters higher up, was
expected to arrive, but no one could say whether
she had been wounded, or whether her cubs
had preceded her. The circle of beaters and
hunters now drew closer in, the <em>matador</em> of the
hunters placed himself close by my side, and drew
my attention to the danger of an attack by so
savage an animal. We waited half an hour for
the decisive moment; unfortunately the she-bear
did not turn up, and the hunters declared it
probable that she had been wounded and had
hidden herself in some rocky crevice, as otherwise
we should certainly have had a shot at her.</p>

<p>"On the way home we witnessed another interesting
scene. At least thirty large golden eagles
had assembled round a carcase on the far side of
a ravine, but the distance was far beyond our
range. I fired at one which was hovering over
my head, but only hit one of his feathers, which
fluttered to the ground. The shot frightened the
interesting inhabitants of the mountains from
their meal, and they flew in all directions between
the rocky spurs, where we were able to follow
them with the naked eye for a long time."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>The same letter also contained a most interesting
picture of the situation of Roumania, both at
home and abroad.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since my last letter to you on April 30
many things have improved here, and every day
shows more and more the advantages of a firm
Government, which alone can secure progress and
increase the prosperity of the country. The loyal
and frank attitude of Catargiu's Ministry has
practically crippled the intrigues of the parties,
the more so since they have no burning question
to exploit. The Opposition Press, it is true, is
not ashamed to publish the grossest calumnies
about the Government, or to prophesy that the
fate of King Otto or the Emperor Maximilian will
befall me unless I dismiss the Ministry soon!
Fortunately their sallies are so violent that no one
places any belief in their screed. As affairs stand
at present only some external crisis can affect the
resignation of the Cabinet; luckily it is in such
favour with the Great Powers that even this
anxiety disappears.... It is the immediate duty
of my Government to maintain order at all costs,
and to aim during the coming session at putting
an end to the abuse of liberty, which only damages
and discredits us in the eyes of foreign countries.
As Roumania is the spoilt child of Europe and
has been permitted to do so much, it knows
nothing of reflection or fear. It is like an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
unbroken foal, which is imbued with liberty, and
ignores every danger. Guizot says: 'There are
times when nations are swayed by their desires
beyond all else, and others where they act solely
in accordance with their fears. According as
the one or the other of these dispositions prevails,
nations are intent on liberty or security for
preference. It is the first degree in the art of
government to distinguish between those sentiments.'
To Roumania liberty is more than
security: she only knows her own desires, and
is fearless. I have not, therefore, been deceived
hitherto about her sentiments, which in the eyes
of the French statesman is the height of statescraft.
For my part I consider that I have committed
an error and that I should have achieved
more if I had sometimes gone against the desires
of the nation!</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I have from the commencement
devoted my whole energy to the
development of the material welfare of these
richly endowed countries. My groundwork was
the execution of the net of roads and railways.
This is the national-Roumanian policy which I
have so far pursued, and which I shall continue
in the future. Perhaps this is the very reason of
the great wrath of those to whom the existence
of Roumania is a thorn in the flesh. The enmity
to which it is exposed by a paid Press is therefore
well founded, for even a small country which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
makes material progress daily may in time become
a factor with which perhaps the world may be
forced to reckon. I have observed two currents
in the policy of Austria-Hungary regarding us:
the official circles appear at present to favour the
stability and peaceful development of Roumania,
whilst others&mdash;I know not how to define them:
clerical, financial, Jewish&mdash;show their animosity
by an incessant paper-warfare against the country.
The Austrian and Hungarian papers compete with
each other in this rivalry. What lasts too long
ends by becoming tedious, and one may hope that
the world will some day have had enough of this
tangled web of printed lies. It may also be that
much of this arrogance is based on Stock Exchange
speculations. The Jewish <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haute finance</i> has declared
that it will not embark upon any business
with "Jew-devouring" Roumania, and will oppose
with all its might any of the country's aims. In
the meantime we have concluded a tobacco
monopoly with a great Hungarian Jewish house,
and obtained an unexpected bid of 8,000,000
francs a year, a brilliant piece of business for both
parties."</p></blockquote>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>August 31st, 1872</i>.</h3>

<p>"Our stay at Sinaja, which, if the weather
holds good, we shall prolong for another four weeks,
suits us excellently. The life here is pleasant and
unconstrained; every day brings fresh interests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
A bevy of young girls adds much liveliness to our
circle; in addition to the lately appointed maid of
honour, Mlle. Valeanu, we recently had seven
young ladies to dinner, with a dance and round
games in the evening. Even nonsense refreshes
the mind, and it was a real benefit to us all to let
ourselves go. We made Costa-Foru dance and
D. Ghika played with us. This is a very different
matter from sitting head over ears in work. Until
to-day it would have been impossible to accuse me
of playing with my present and former Ministers,
and hence it is a real satisfaction to me to have
done so in Sinaja. Moreover, our stay here is of
great benefit to us in many ways: it brings us
into closer contact with people than would be
possible in the city, where everything is red tape;
we have also had the pleasant experience that, in
spite of the difficulty of communication, everybody
seems delighted to come here. We have had
numerous visitors even from Moldavia....</p>

<p>"On September 8 our little Marie will be two
years old, but she might easily pass for three, for
her mental and physical development is far more
mature than that of most children of two years old.
You ought to see my little daughter now, my
dear parents. You would certainly take as great a
pleasure in her as we do ourselves; she already
speaks three languages&mdash;Roumanian, German, and,
above all, English; is very independent, runs about
alone, calls everybody by his proper name, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
on Sundays goes to the chapel of the Monastery,
where she keeps quite quiet during the service.
Her character is amiable and gentle; she obeys
every order, and gives up all her little possessions
with pleasure."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The birthday of the little Princess was celebrated
in the same way as the year before, with
the ceremony of breaking a cake over her little
fair head, and with serenades, and fireworks. The
childlike grace and charm with which her Serene
Highness accepted the homage captivated all
hearts.</p>


<h3><i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">German Crown Prince</span>, <i>October 8th, 1872</i>.</h3>

<p>"We have been permitted, after many storms,
to spend a quiet and happy summer, admiring
nature and art, and visited by people of all kinds
and of all nationalities&mdash;mutable and merry,
despite the stillness of the cloister surrounded by
giant mountains. Even a few Englishmen put in
an appearance, and I gave them the heartier
welcome for the hope that they will now spread
healthier ideas about Oriental countries amongst
their fellow countrymen. Unfortunately the shade
of Palmerston still moves amongst England's diplomatists,
and her inhabitants are more Turkish
than the Turks themselves, which fact you will be
able to estimate correctly, as you are acquainted
with Turkish rule. I have said this to all who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
came, and I hope that the Foreign Office will
acquire a more just appreciation, particularly of
the territories of the Danube."</p>


<h3><i>From the</i> <span class="smcap">German Crown Prince</span>, <i>October 28th, 1872</i>.</h3>

<p>"We fared very well during the summer;
my wife and I and our two youngest children
enjoyed the Alps in Berchtesgaden and Salzburg,
a region which we find extraordinarily attractive.</p>

<p>"There, as in the whole of South Germany,
where later on I inspected troops, a reception was
prepared for me as hearty and brilliant as any in
the old Mother Country. The feeling of cohesion
amongst all German races since the re-establishment
of the German Empire has spread in those
parts extraordinarily, broadly, and quickly. All
feel themselves elevated and strengthened; they
see themselves as members of a nation which commands
a respect such as the former thirty Fatherlands
could never have commanded. The enemies
of our union, against whom we struggle, cannot prevail
in face of this political power, but they will leave
no means of damaging it untried. Only we must
not make a mistake in our choice of weapons, for
otherwise we shall make martyrs of our opponents,
and shall reap neither thanks nor advantage."</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>November 26th, 1872</i>.</h3>

<p>"The burning question in the new German
Empire is the Church. This question is making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
a great stir and embittering family life; it
undoubtedly points to future danger, since the
Ultramontane Party will use it as a lever to
intrigue against the new German Empire and the
Protestant Emperor. Simply to oppose Germany,
France is highly in favour of Rome and everything
connected with it, and so she is enlisting the
sympathies of our Ultras, who believe, or wish to
have it believed, that France is the only sanctuary
of Catholicism, and that Prussia's policy is universal
evangelisation. This tendency in France
is at present a means of agitation, inspired by
revenge and not by the glorification of the Church.</p>

<p>"The boundaries between the powers of the
State and the Church are to be regulated by
legislation in Berlin. This problem may possibly
be solved in theory, but never in practice. When
my opinion was asked, I advised the Emperor to
decide each concrete case with the utmost rigour,
but never to embark upon disputes about theoretical
dogmas&mdash;history teaches that in such
struggles the State invariably comes off the worst.
The introduction of civil marriage, the separation
of the schools from the Church, and the establishment
of State examinations for the clergy are
alone excepted from this. The Church must be
left to herself; the State has nothing to do with
dogmas, which depend entirely upon the conscience
of Catholics.</p>

<p>"You have no idea of the agitation which these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
questions are causing just now, or of the prevailing
misconceptions.</p>

<p>"It is well that the Jesuit law is, so to speak,
an already surmounted vantage-point; but those
who expect improvement from it are mistaken;
the greater part of the Catholic priesthood of to-day
has been educated by the Jesuits. The whole
struggle is grievous.</p>

<p>"If the contending parties had long ago arrived
at an understanding, particularly in the time of
King Frederick William IV., that the Throne
and the Altar are two irreconcilable conceptions,
it might have been possible to regulate their
relation without the intervention of force. But
that ruler's absolutist tendencies sought and found
in the absolutism of Rome an alliance which is
still a heavy burden upon our national development.</p>

<p>"You will certainly have followed the debates
on the '<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kreisordnung</i>' in the Upper House with
interest. To myself it is a brilliant satisfaction
for the wrongs suffered in 1859 and 1860; what
I then prophesied has happened to-day&mdash;the
Upper House is an institution whose entire composition
stands in urgent need of reform.</p>

<p>"The situation in Bavaria and Württemberg,
especially in the dynastic spheres, is scarcely yet
intelligible. Particularism is as obstinate as
possible. The unification of the Empire from a
military point of view is proceeding smoothly, and
will not recede; but the minor Sovereigns take it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
very ill that they are to be mediatised in a
military and diplomatic sense at once...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The unexpected news of the death of
Napoleon III. was received at Bucharest on
January 10, 1873. Prince Charles and the
Roumanian nation were deeply moved by this sad
event, for the dead Emperor had been the champion
and protector of the national existence of
Roumania in its darkest days. Throughout the
whole land memorial services were held, though
the Metropolitan at first objected on the ground
that the late Emperor was not a member of the
Orthodox Church. The universal expression of
sympathy with the widowed Empress and the
Prince Imperial created a certain friction with the
Republican Government, and the Foreign Minister
reminded M. Strat that the Roumanians ought
not to forget that, after all, "it was to France,
and not the Emperor, that gratitude was due"!
M. Thiers, the President, also expressed his vexation
that the Roumanian Chambers should have
sent messages of condolence to the Prince Imperial
as well as to the Empress, since the former had
never had anything to do with Roumania. This
measure was considered to indicate that Roumania
held the French Republic "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nul et non avenu</i>."
M. Thiers concluded with the remark: "If I had
acted strictly in accordance with the rules of
international custom, I should have recalled all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
my agents and broken off all communication with
you!" M. Strat was able, however, to convince
the President that Roumania had only paid a
debt of gratitude to a benefactor, and had no
intention of insulting France.</p>

<p>The situation in Paris at the commencement of
1873 was described by M. Strat as "the same
struggles, the same defiance in every camp, and
the same uncertainty about the future as in the
past." A sort of armistice existed between M.
Thiers and the Majority of the National Assembly,
who were anxious to foist a King upon France,
whilst the adherents of the Republic were divided
into two camps. "Those who desire a moderate
and conservative republic do nothing to bring
it to pass, and those who wish for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> on
the lines of Gambetta &amp; Co. do everything in
their power to render it permanently impossible."
Gambetta's school, which unfortunately had made
proselytes throughout the whole of Europe, aimed
at "governing by inane discourses, banquets,
harangues, demonstrations in the streets, and all
the customary trappings of a vulgar democracy."
Hampered by all these conflicting elements, M.
Thiers was confronted by the task of maintaining
order, paying milliards, and raising the commerce
of the country. He would only secure peace with
the National Assembly if he gave it complete
liberty "to play upon that instrument which they
call universal suffrage."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>On February 13 King Amadeo of Spain
announced in a special message to the Cortes
that he had laid the crown aside, under the conviction
that the incessant struggles of the parties
were frustrating all his efforts for the peace and
happiness of his country. The Cortes, by a large
majority, proclaimed the Republic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour l'éternité</i>,
and elected as their President a well-known and
thorough-going Republican, Senor Fiqueras. And
so the saying of Napoleon III., that a Latin race
is almost ungovernable, received a melancholy confirmation,
which was only partly refuted by the
Prince Charles's unquestioned success in ruling
the "Latin sister-nation." Public opinion was
only now beginning to realise the great merit of
the Prince in achieving, by patience, abnegation,
and perseverance, a stable Government, which
only a few years before had appeared to be an aim
Utopian and altogether beyond realisation to all
those who were acquainted with the people and
the affairs of Roumania.</p>

<p>Prince Charles was invited by the Emperor of
Austria to attend the Vienna Exhibition, where
Roumanian commerce was to be represented by
exhibits of tobacco, wool, silk, wood, salt and other
minerals. There were scarcely any manufactures,
but the Prince was confident that they would
soon follow in the track of the railways.</p>

<p>The Princess, whose health had not been at all
satisfactory, and her little daughter, set out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
a visit to the Princess of Wied on May 31, 1873.
Little Marie soon became accustomed to the motion
of the yacht, and took the greatest interest in her
first long journey. Neuwied was reached safely,
and the first news which Prince Charles received
on June 23 in Vienna was that they were delighted
to be home, and that the German Crown Prince had
given them a most hearty welcome.</p>

<p>Prince Charles received the same treatment at
Vienna, where he found his brother, the Hereditary
Prince Leopold, awaiting him. He could
not fail to notice that the reception accorded to
him in 1873 was far more cordial than that in
1869, and he found, too, that his labours and
sacrifices during the last four years had at last
received due recognition in the Press.</p>

<p>Count Andrassy had a long and important
interview with Prince Charles on June 25, when
the Prince mentioned his project of declaring
Roumania an independent State, because the
relations with the Porte only led to constant
friction, and were prejudicial to the welfare of his
country. Moreover, a free Roumania, he held,
would be a better friend to Turkey than it
could possibly be under the existing circumstances.
Count Andrassy pointed out that Roumania, as an
independent State, would be exposed to danger
from outside, while at present her safety was
guaranteed by conventions and treaties. At the
same time he gave emphatic denial to the rumour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
that Austria had any intention of annexing
Roumanian territory. "We should be acting
against our own interests, were we to increase the
number of our discontented Roumanian subjects,
and extend our frontier against Russia." Prince
Charles replied that it would always be his aim
to remain strictly neutral between his two all-powerful
neighbours, Austria and Russia.</p>

<p>The Roumanian section in the exhibition was
altogether successful; the centre of attraction was
a portrait by an American painter, Healy, of the
Prince in cavalry uniform, and of the Princess in
national costume. The many-coloured carpets and
woven silks also received great commendation, as
well as the wines of the country.</p>

<p>The Prince quitted Vienna on July 1 by the
train which carried the German Empress back to
Germany. The Empress expressed herself greatly
pleased at the reception accorded her by the
Austrian capital, especially by the amiability of
the Emperor Francis Joseph. After a short stay
at Neuwied Prince Charles proceeded to Ems to
see the Czar before the latter left for Russia, and
to congratulate him in person upon the approaching
marriage of the Grand Duchess Marie to the
Duke of Edinburgh. A couple of days later the
Prince and Princess again visited Ems, this time
to see the German Emperor, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for Imnau,
where they expected to rejoin the Princess of
Wied. The Emperor William welcomed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Roumanian guests with the utmost cordiality and
affection, and declared himself delighted with the
improved relations of the Prince to the Austro-Hungarian
State. He again pointed out to his
young cousin the necessity of paying particular
attention to his army, and reminded him that a
small but well-disciplined force was far superior to a
more numerous though less highly trained army.</p>

<p>An amusing adventure happened to the Prince
and Princess on their way to Imnau at Giessen,
where they had the misfortune to miss their
train, and were forced to spend the night at a
small hotel near the railway station, without
either luggage or sufficient money to pay for
their railway-tickets. As they desired to preserve
their incognito, they determined to make use of
their "honest looks" to induce the hotel-keeper
to advance the necessary sum of money. This
hope, it is pleasant to note, was not cherished in
vain, and Imnau was reached on July 8. The
Prince's parents remained at Hechingen, which
lies only a short distance from Imnau, but met
every day either at one place or the other, so that
Prince Charles Anthony's favourite wish was at last
fulfilled. In this peaceful fashion a month passed
only too quickly, and, after a couple of days spent
at Krauchenwies the wanderers returned to Sinaja
on August 28, touching Vienna <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i>, so that
the Princess might also have an opportunity of
visiting the exhibition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The affairs of Roumania were absolutely uneventful,
and the efforts of the Prince, warmly
supported by the Ministry, made satisfactory
progress towards the attainment of the high ideal
which Prince Charles had kept before him ever
since he first took up his arduous task. In a
letter written to his parents at Christmas the
Prince remarked: "Roumania has never witnessed
so peaceful or, in many respects, so happy a year
as 1873. The general progress is excellent, and
the good understanding between the Government
and the Chambers still continues."</p>

<p>The early part of 1874 was darkened by the
illness of Princess Elisabeth, who was seized by a
contagious disease whilst supervising the distribution
of gifts to the poor children of Bucharest.
Fortunately the trouble abated in time to enable
the Princess to enjoy the visit of her brother-in-law,
Prince Frederick. Princess Marie, too, was
not spared by the epidemic, and for a few days
her condition caused the gravest anxiety to her
parents.</p>


<h3><i>From the</i> <span class="smcap">German Crown Prince</span>, <i>March 21st, 1874</i>.</h3>

<p>"You will certainly have followed with sympathy
the course of the lamentable religio-political
struggle between our Government and
the Papal Curia. I am sorry that it should have
occurred; but I foresaw it, as the custom,
established these thirty years, of giving way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the demands of Rome rather than maintaining a
firm position could not possibly continue. I
think, perhaps, a different sequence in the legislature
might have been observed; but since the
struggle has been undertaken we must carry it
through. Austria, very opportunely for us, is
beginning to adopt a similar attitude.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that there should be a current
report that the Government wishes to attack the
Catholic Church and its dogmas for their own sake.
Every one who is capable of calm deliberation must
know that nothing is further from our thoughts."</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>April 7th, 1874</i>.</h3>

<p>"I write to you oppressed by care and anxiety
on account of our dear child, who is suffering from
scarlet fever. On Saturday she was quite well,
and drove out with us in the warm spring
weather; early on Sunday she complained of not
being well. Her malady increased towards midday,
and was accompanied by sickness. Towards
evening she became very restless and feverish,
and Dr. Theodori recognised the symptoms of a
dangerous illness. The poor child passed a very
bad night, moaning and sleepless, whilst we
watched by her bedside; at 2 <small>A.M.</small> her skin
became deep red, and her temperature rose considerably.
Theodori came at eight o'clock and
pronounced it to be scarlet fever. At noon her
whole body was burning with heat, and her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
was affected. The doctor then informed me that
the illness was so dangerous that he should like
another opinion. A consultation took place the
same evening in the sick-room, to which the local
medical authorities were summoned. They did
not conceal her serious condition from us, and
declared that her age added to their anxiety.</p>

<p>"Another bad night was passed, but the fever
was less intense the following morning; there
was no question of sleep. We do not lose our
courage, and trust in God, who will not abandon
us in the hour of our trouble...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After a slight improvement on the 8th the
condition of the child became so alarming at
midnight that her parents, who had not left her
side till eleven <small>P.M.</small>, were again summoned to her
bed. They found their little daughter gasping
for breath. The hastily summoned physicians
declared the condition of their patient to be
hopeless. As she lay in the lap of her English
nurse, the child's strength seemed to ebb with
every minute, and as the first rays of the rising
sun touched the windows of the room, the
despairing parents were kneeling by the lifeless
body of their only child. Only a short time
could be given them to be near her; the little
coffin was closed, and carried by the grief-stricken
father out of the death-chamber. A long procession
accompanied the body of the little Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to the Church of Cotroceni, where it was to
remain until the morrow, which was Good
Friday. At two o'clock the last sad rites of the
Orthodox Church were celebrated in the presence
of an enormous concourse of sympathetic representatives
of every class of society.</p>


<h3><i>From the</i> <span class="smcap">German Crown Prince</span>.</h3>

<p>"We have just received the unexpected and
afflicting news of the terrible misfortune that
has befallen you. May God's grace be with you
and grant you strength to bear the desperate
sorrow, the burden of which we know from our
own experience! In thought I put myself in
your frame of mind, and realise that you must
both be numbed with grief at seeing your sweet
child lifeless before you, and at knowing that you
can never again see a light in her dear eyes,
never again a smile on her face!</p>

<p>"These are hours in which, in spite of all Christian
principles, one still asks: why need it have
been? And certainly it is hard to say: 'Thy will
be done!'</p>

<p>"I wrote this text on the tomb of my son Sigismund,
your god-child, because I know of no other
consolation: and yet I cannot conquer that pain
to-day, though many years have already passed,
and though God has given me a large family.
Time does certainly blunt the keenest edge of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
parent's anguish, but it does not remove the
burden, which remains a companion for life....</p>

<p>"Your grief is also ours, and you are both the
object of our anxiety and our prayers; for that
my wife is at one with me in these thoughts of
sympathy you know as well as that these lines
are for poor Elisabeth no less than for you. God
be with you, and be merciful to you!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the following letter, addressed to the President
of the Ministry, Prince Charles endeavoured
to thank his people for their sympathy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Almighty has summoned our only and
dearly loved child from this world of trouble.</p>

<p>"If a proof of my country's devotion had
been needed, it could not have been shown
in a more affecting manner than in these
days of sorrow, when the sense of the sincere
sympathy of all has been our chief consolation in
distress.</p>

<p>"And so I desire to assure my country that
just as it has supported me by its affection in
the hardest moment of my life, so I shall endeavour
to repay in good measure the kindness which it
has manifested towards me.</p>

<p>"The sweetest memory which our lost daughter
has left us as an inestimable treasure is her
boundless love for the country in which she was
born, a love so strong that despite her tender age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
she felt the pangs of home sickness during her
first stay abroad.</p>

<p>"Our child's faith and the language which she
spoke have assumed a new sanctity in our eyes,
for every Roumanian word will from henceforth
be to us the echo of that voice which we shall
never again hear on earth.</p>

<p>"Though the dearest and most intimate bond of
our family circle has been severed, a still stronger
tie unites us now with our greater family, the
Roumanian nation, which joins with us in mourning
the loss of our and their child.</p>

<p>"It is a sacred duty with the Princess and
myself to express to one and all, from the depth
of our sorely tried hearts, our cordial gratitude,
together with the hope that all will unite with us
in prayer that the Almighty may grant us strength
and patience in the trial which He, the Father of
All, has in His inscrutable wisdom sent to us."</p></blockquote>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>April 15th, 1874</i>.</h3>

<p>"What terrible news! Though yesterday we
awaited your telegram not without anxiety, still
we were reassured towards evening. As long as
I live I shall not forget to-day's awakening&mdash;I
opened the telegram without agitation&mdash;speechless,
and with the keenest heartache, I read it
again and again. For a long time I could not
believe in the possibility of the destruction of your
domestic happiness. God's ways are inscrutable!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
He has for only too short a time entrusted to you
a being whom He loved so much that he could
not but recall her to Him. These lines are not
meant to console you, for at such moments there
can be no consolation: they are only to remind us
all that we must humbly submit, come what
may!"</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>May 5th</i>.</h3>

<p>"We established ourselves here (Cotroceni)
yesterday, and we hope to find more peace and a
little consolation for our sorrowing hearts, since
we shall now be close to the resting-place of our
loved child. The palace in the capital seemed so
empty and melancholy to us that we awaited with
impatience the day when we could leave it. But
we shall feel our loss bitterly even here. Our
daily walk is to her grave, where we sit and talk
over the legacy of rich and manifold memories left
us by our dear child. The whole country mourns
for little Marie; this you know, and will have
seen from our newspapers; many expressions of
sympathy have also reached us from abroad. The
German Emperor wrote me a very kind letter in
which he shows his true kindness of heart. I also
received a letter from the King of Italy, and
Elisabeth one from the Queen of England, which
was couched in very warm and affectionate terms.
The Empress Eugénie also telegraphed her
sympathy with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"... Elisabeth's nerves are so shaken that the
greatest care is necessary. I must confess to you
that I am often anxious myself, and am much
depressed by pain, sorrow, and apprehension. I get
but very little sleep at night, and have repeatedly
heard my poor Elisabeth cry out in her dreams:
'Dead, dead!' This cry of pain is each time a
fresh stab in my wounded heart!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whilst Princess Elisabeth sought to conquer
her grief by distraction in translating Roumanian
legends and fairy tales, Prince Charles's time was
claimed by affairs of State. Great Britain, in
pursuit of its Turkophile policy, wished to accredit
its new agent, Mr. Vivian, with a letter in which
mention was made of the "good relations which
exist between England and the Sublime Porte and
the territory governed by your Highness." The
Roumanian Government declined to receive this
communication, but the incident was eventually
settled by an exchange of Notes between the
English Consul-General and the Minister for
Foreign Affairs. Mr. Vivian had a private
audience on May 4 with the Prince, who expressed
his opinion very plainly on the Oriental policy of
England.</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>May 26th, 1874</i>.</h3>

<p>"We are impatiently awaiting Leopold's arrival,
which is promised for Monday. The Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Servia will have left us by then; he has truly
Oriental ideas of hospitality! We hold aloof
from all public entertainments in his honour, and
only invite him now and again to dinner or tea.
Every time he comes to Cotroceni he brings a
wreath, which he places, either with his own hand
or by another's, on the grave of our child. He is
a very pleasant, bright, and handsome man, an
excellent talker; he is by nature gifted with
understanding, but is deficient in higher culture.
His visit here is making a great impression in
Constantinople, which he quitted in anger. The
Servians are now on a worse footing with Turkey
than we are, since they have been refused Swornik.
After voting us addresses of condolence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in corpore</i>

Ministry and to form a coalition."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On June 7 a law was passed providing for the
allotment of land in Bessarabia to the Bulgarians
expelled from the right bank of the river. This
measure was warmly advocated by the Russian
Consul-General, but Prince Charles, mindful of
Russia's declaration in 1871, was disquieted by
the discovery that the Russian Government had
not surrendered its hopes of the reacquisition
of Bessarabia.</p>

<p>After a short stay in the pleasant groves of
breezy Sinaja the journey to Franzensbad was
commenced on July 15 in the company of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Hereditary Prince. The Princess of Hohenzollern
arrived a few days later alone, Prince Charles
Anthony's infirmities keeping him practically a
prisoner in his room. Prince Charles was
delighted to find that his mother's health
was unaffected by her exertions: "We are inexpressibly
happy to have her here, but reproach
ourselves for having taken her from you, and we
are grieved that you should remain alone at
Krauchenwies. We fully appreciate the sacrifice
you have made for us, and thank you with all
our hearts.</p>

<p>"The Empress had been so kind as to inquire
from the Queen of England what watering-place
would suit us best. The latter replied by
telegraph that her physician, Sir W. Jenner,
recommended Eastbourne for Elisabeth 'and her
husband.'</p>

<p>"When ladies of so high degree look after a
watering-place for us, we ought certainly to reap
the full benefit from our stay! We shall,
therefore, probably go to Eastbourne or Hastings.</p>

<p>"One day is very much like another, and we
live solely according to the '<i>Kur</i>.'... These
places in Bohemia are fortunately so accustomed
to Royal visitors that a Queen and an Oriental
Prince create very little stir."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>After paying a flying visit to the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Emperor at Eger the Prince and Princess arrived
in London on August 19. The Marchioness of
Lorne came to express the Queen's regret at her
inability to receive the travellers, as she was about
to set out for Scotland. The Prince of Wales
and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh welcomed
Prince Charles and his wife with warm
sympathy. The young Duchess of Edinburgh
had changed greatly since the first time Prince
Charles saw her at Livadia in 1869. Then she
left the impression of a charming child, but now
she appeared with all the character of a young
mother.</p>

<p>During their three weeks' stay at St. Leonard's
the Prince and Princess made many excursions
to Brighton, Oxford, Woolwich, Chislehurst,
and the neighbouring country seats of the
nobility. The visit to Oxford, with Professor
Max Müller as <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cicerone</i>, was of especial interest
to the Prince, who was much impressed by the
ancient University, with its glorious colleges. By
the courtesy of the Secretary of War, Gathorne
Hardy, Prince Charles was able to make a minute
inspection of the Woolwich Arsenal. The Prince
was astonished to find that the heaviest naval
guns for the British fleet were still built on the
muzzle-loading principle, and endeavoured, without
much success, to convince his guide, Major-General
Simmons, of the advantages of the
breechloading system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Several very pleasant hours were spent at Lord
Brassey's castle and on board his yacht. Lord
Brassey had visited Roumania on several occasions,
as he was interested in the Offenheim
railway concession, and was, therefore, no stranger
to the Prince. A couple of visits were also paid
to Holmebury House to Lady Mary Anne
Alford and her brother, Mr. Leveson-Gower, whose
brother, Lord Granville, had formerly been in
communication with Roumania as Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs.</p>


<h3>"<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>.</h3>

<p>"We shall commemorate in quiet and grief the
birthday of our dear daughter on the 8th of September.
She was the light of our home life. Now
this anniversary will only teach us, as each year
comes round, that this earthly life, with all its
pleasures and sorrows, is but the preparation for
a better life, and that, therefore, we must not cling
too much to the things of this world. England by
no means seems full of this sentiment. I believe
that in no other country has materialism gone to
such a length as here. People live solely to enjoy
their lives&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et voilà tout</i>. Commerce and industry,
therefore, flourish, which bring in money, and
money is the essential requisite for English
comfort!</p>

<p>"I discussed the social condition of England
with Max Müller, and derived much benefit from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the insight into the situation here which I owe to
him.</p>

<p>"Roumania is a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">terra incognita</i> here, and the

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lord Derby, in reply to a letter from Prince
Charles, who expressed his regret at not having
met the Foreign Secretary in London, professed
his deep concern at being unable to pay the
Prince a visit before his departure from England.</p>

<p>On the way home Prince Charles visited the
Oriental Congress in London, where representatives
of all Eastern nations were assembled.
Amongst others, the Prince made the acquaintance
of Sir Henry Rawlinson, the decipherer of
the cuneiform inscriptions; of Léon Rosnez, the
learned exponent of Semitic languages; of Sir
Henry Bartle Frere; of Sir John Lubbock and
Charles Kingsley. The majority of these were
presented to Prince Charles at a Mansion House
banquet given in honour of the Oriental Congress.
The quaint ceremonies, the ancient costumes of
the civic dignitaries, the luxury and wealth of
the table appointments, and the excellent music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
discoursed during the dinner all contributed to
attract the Prince's attention and interest.</p>

<p>The homeward journey lay through Paris, where
the ruins of the Tuileries awakened melancholy
reflections; Strassburg, which still bore plain traces
of siege, to the Weinburg where Prince Charles
Anthony was feverishly awaiting their arrival.
The meeting was most affecting, and the memories
awakened by the deep mourning of his children
almost overcame the aged Prince, whose bodily
infirmities were increasing with every year. The
stay at the Weinburg ended on October 8. Prince
Charles Anthony's bodily suffering, though borne
with heroic courage, threw a melancholy shadow
over the otherwise happy home life of the
Hohenzollern family.</p>

<p>With their return to Sinaja the grief of the
unfortunate parents was constantly aroused by
the absence of their dear one from the rooms which
once were enlivened by her presence; the very
gloom of the weather seemed to encourage this
melancholy mood.</p>


<h3><i>From the</i> <span class="smcap">German Emperor</span>, <i>September 26th, 1874</i>.</h3>

<p>"I was very pleased to make the acquaintance

journey this time should have been undertaken
solely on account of the health of both of you, and
that, moreover, your mood was not such as to care
to make any visits except in the narrowest family

give us the pleasure and joy of seeing you here.
In any case I am happy to have spoken with you,

<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>November 28th</i>.</h3>

<p>"We quitted Sinaja three weeks ago with
heavy hearts to return to Bucharest. The weather
remained beautiful until a week ago, and our
longing for the mountains was increased; the
more so as the empty rooms of the Palace can
never appear lively. We endeavour to distract
ourselves as much as possible and invite people to
dinner every day, but nothing can make us forget
the dear voice of our child, which we miss everywhere
and at all times.</p>

<p>"I opened the Chamber yesterday. My speech
was short, and touched only on practical questions.</p>

<p>"The question of the commercial treaties is on
the high road to an immediate solution, the only
difficulties are matters of detail. We are now
negotiating with Austria-Hungary, whose interest
it is to enter on closer relations with us both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
politically and commercially. Even now the Porte
cannot grow resigned to a defeat which is due to
its own lack of skill. England, France, and Italy
will have no course left but to adopt the same line
as the three other Great Powers; their representatives
here are quite willing to influence their
Governments in our favour. We have every
reason to be satisfied with our Diplomatic Corps;
France and England, in particular, have sent us
amiable and experienced men, who have already
travelled throughout the country, and can judge
of our circumstances with intelligence. They have
both pleaded for the commercial conventions in
their reports."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A most interesting and important report on the
condition of the Servian forces in 1874 was
received on January 9, 1875. M. Sturdza prefaced
his remarks by insisting upon the extreme difficulty
of ascertaining the truth about Servia: Chauvinism
and love of exaggeration conspired to keep
strangers in the dark. He had, however, been
able to discover enough to prove that the Servian
troops were, strictly speaking, no army at all.
Both quality and quantity left much to be desired,
whilst the standing force of 5000 men was hardly
sufficient to keep order in the interior. The permanent
force of cavalry amounted to but one solitary
squadron, whilst only one battery was armed
with modern guns. The fortresses were in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
indefensible condition, as their sole armament consisted
of the guns which the Turks had left there.
The Territorial Army was of still less value than
the standing army. Without officers and without
equipment or proper arms it in no way deserved
serious consideration. The political situation of
Servia also gave rise to considerable doubt as to
the stability of Prince Milan's Government. The
Press constantly urged the Croats, Slavonians, and
Hungarian Servians to rebel against Austria.
Prince Milan had flouted Germany by his openly
expressed sympathy with France, whilst England's
favour had been lost by the anti-Turkish policy of
the Ministry. Russia, Servia's best friend, had
supported the Ministry, until it applied to the
French Ambassador in Constantinople for his
assistance in the Swornik question. Count Ignatiew
was so much exasperated by this step that
he counselled the Porte to resist the demands for
the withdrawal of the Turkish troops from that
fortress.</p>

<p>The attitude of the populace of Montenegro and
Herzegowina towards Turkey threatened most
serious complications in January 1875. The massacres
of Christians at Podgoritza late in 1874 still
remained unpunished, though the instigators had
already been sentenced by Turkish Courts. Representations
to the Sublime Porte resulted in the
preposterous demand that the Montenegrins, who
had been the cause of the disturbance, should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
tried by a Turkish Court before the sentences on
the Ottoman officials were carried out. Eventually
the Ambassadors of the Powers succeeded
in persuading the Porte to abandon this
claim.</p>

<p>Prince Milan's popularity had suffered greatly
by his favouritism and caprice, whilst his Ministry
seemed to aim either at forcing him to abdicate,
or at least at putting such difficulties in his way
that the Powers would be forced to intervene, and
thus effect his fall. His long stay in Paris in 1874,
together with his unbounded extravagance, gave
rise to most unfavourable comment. "It is
asserted that the Prince's debts now amount to
the whole of his private fortune. Bills of exchange
arrive every day from abroad and cannot be paid.
His landed property in Wallachia will be invaded.
Expedients for borrowing from all sides are seen
at the Palace. Many people here, even peasants,
are owed money. The civil list has been spent six
months in advance."</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Professor Max Müller</span>.</h3>

<p>"... I only now realise the magnitude of the
work your Highness has undertaken, a work which
demands the highest form of heroism, the heroism
of patience! To sow without the hope of enjoying
the harvest demands a degree of faith such as
is not common in the present day. If I were
younger, I would enthusiastically offer my services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to the warden of European culture on the Danube,
and would leave him no peace until the schools
and universities had become the pride of his
people and an example to the whole world. Guns
are wanted; railways are wanted; but, above all,
schools are wanted; they are the most sacred
duty of all! It is often hard to love or to benefit
our neighbours, but we can all love and benefit
our own posterity. When the Budget of Love
(education) is as high as the Budget of Hatred
(war), the Eastern Marches will be under the protection
of Europe even without treaties.</p>

<p>"Public opinion in England remains unaltered&mdash;the
arrival of a telegram from the Danube
makes us tremble in every limb. Two reasons for
this are apparent. Humanity is the slave of
phrase, and the phrase, 'integrity of the Ottoman
Empire,' is as much a matter of course to the
English as 'Britannia rules the waves.' Such
phrases have a firmer hold on English policy than
on French or German. The Turkish funds form
the second reason...."</p>

<p>On February 14, 1875, Prince Charles received
the Spanish Ambassador, who came to announce
the accession of Alfonso De Borbon y Borbone "by
the Grace of God and the National Will King of
Spain." Don Gherardi was received with every
honour usual on such occasions at the European
Courts. Though this step of the King of Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
was entirely due to his personal relations to
the Roumanian Court, and not to any political
motive, it nevertheless caused much excitement
in diplomatic circles, as it was practically tantamount
to the recognition of the independence of
Roumania. The Sublime Porte at once demanded
satisfaction from Spain, and declared that Turkey
would not recognise the new kingdom until such
satisfaction had been given.</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>.</h3>

<p>"One of the most ridiculous and narrow-minded
of political interests is the unbounded
importance attached to the Spanish notification
to Bucharest, which is treated as seriously as
though the whole Eastern Question depended
upon it. The English papers, followed by
those of Berlin, never tire of discussing this
matter from every point of view. It is truly
ridiculous, but, on the other hand, discloses
the still prevailing aversion from your emancipation."</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>March 19th, 1875</i>.</h3>

<p>"We lost all communication with abroad and
the interior for a whole month in consequence of
heavy snowstorms. Many accidents and considerable
losses have occurred which will be more
severely felt here, where misfortunes, as well as
prosperity, are ascribed to the Government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
than elsewhere. It is hard to realise the
sufferings of the poor peasants: famine and
typhus raged in several villages; and it was
impossible to send them help! No one dared to
go out of doors on account of the multitude of
wolves which infested every locality in search
of food. According to official reports, these
brutes have devoured a number of human
beings and cattle, whilst the bears have done
equal damage on the mountains! The total
suspension of railway traffic has caused a most
unwelcome loss of 3,000,000 francs to the State
at a moment when the deficit had been covered
with difficulty. Trade also has suffered materially,
as all business was interrupted; the
Exchequer has had no money for the last ten
days, as no remittances arrived from the districts&mdash;and
all payments had to be suspended in consequence!
All this had a serious effect on every
one; discontent and ill-humour prevail everywhere!...</p>

<p>"The slowness of the present thaw will, it is to
be hoped, prevent larger inundations; the streets
in town, however, are in an incredible state; locomotion
is only possible in sleighs&mdash;which are in
imminent danger of being capsized. This happened
to us last week, but we escaped unhurt.
Elisabeth was delighted at the adventure, but I
am ashamed at having been upset in my capital!
Our hound, Mentor, was so terrified by this accident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
that he refused to get into the sleigh again,
and went home on foot....</p>

<p>"Russia and Germany have declared themselves
willing to negotiate commercial and consular
conventions with us. England regrets that
she has not been able to frustrate the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait
accompli</i>, but, nevertheless, makes a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne mine
à mauvais jeu</i>. Yet she could not help inciting
the Sublime Porte, by her very anti-Roumanian
representative in Constantinople, to issue the
ridiculous protest about the Spanish notification.
This was an ill turn to Turkey, as an innocent
affair was expanded into a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cause célèbre</i>....
The expenditure of 5,000,000 francs (for warlike
purposes) produces not a little disquiet, and has
set England against us; and yet England is one
of the keenest competitors for the contract! Very
significant!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On March 28, 1875, the Chambers legislative
period of four years came to an end. Not only
was it the first time that one and the same
Chamber had sat for the full term, but it was also
the first time that the same Ministry had both
opened and closed the Chamber, an achievement
which speaks volumes for the progress and
development of the Principalities during this
period.</p>

<p>Prince Charles accepted the presidency of the
Bucharest Jockey Club, founded by Mr. Vivian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the English Consul-General, in April 1875. At a
banquet on April 18 the Prince expressed the
hope that the foundation of the Club would be
beneficial to horse-breeding in Roumania, and
restore the industry to the position it held in the
time of Frederick the Great, who procured part of
his remounts from Moldavia.</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>.</h3>

<p>"My life is so quiet and lonely that my
connection with the outer world is actually based
on confidential letters and the newspapers alone.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I am very well posted, and
am daily better able to appreciate that one sees,
hears, and judges all the more clearly for being
more concentrated and quiet. Unfortunately I
cannot say that the policy of the young German
Empire satisfies me at present.</p>

<p>"The demand on the Italian Government about
the Papal Guarantee law appears to me to be
out of place. Difficulties increase every day in
the religious-political field, and it does not seem
clear how we are to get out of it without
entrenching on matters of Catholic belief. I
certainly am no Ultramontane; but my objective
sense of justice revolts against our tactics, groping
wholly in the dark against a power which possesses
an unparalleled spiritual influence. Our alliances
at present are more of a personal nature than
based upon mutual interests. Fortunately the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
universal desire for peace has now gained the
upper hand everywhere.</p>

<p>"Everything seems to be going well and quietly
with you; it is to be hoped that the elections
will not cause too great excitement in the country.
However, you are already more or less accustomed
to these agitations: and with <i>sangfroid</i> one may
regulate much which at first appears to be overwhelming."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As a matter of fact, with the exception of a
couple of student demonstrations in Bucharest,
the elections took place in perfect peace and
order, and resulted again in a large majority for
the Conservative Government. The Opposition,
it is true, attempted to prove that the Ministry
had influenced the elections, and twelve Liberal
judges of the first instance resigned as a protest.</p>

<p>One of the first duties of the new Chamber
was the election of a successor to the venerable
Niphon, the Metropolitan of Bucharest, who died
suddenly on May 17, 1875, at the age of eighty-four.
The body, in accordance with a strange old
custom, was seated on the archiepiscopal throne
in the Metropolie, dressed in full canonicals&mdash;a
picture of peaceful and spiritual dignity. Countless
numbers of orthodox believers thronged the
church to kiss the Metropolitan's hand for the
last time. All through the night priests chanted
before the altar, whilst high and low, rich and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
poor, passed in one long line before the dead
Prince of the Church.</p>

<p>Owing to the great heat it was found impossible
to comply with the custom of carrying the
seated corpse to the monastery of Cernica. Four
priests therefore held the chair on a hearse open
on all four sides, and thus bore the venerated
priest to the burial-place of his predecessors.
Many of the spectators threw themselves to the
ground as the procession passed them.</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>June 21st, 1875</i>.</h3>

<p>"I write to you to-day with painful emotion,
after an escape from a great danger.... The
railway journey to Giurgiu, when I was accompanied
by a number of senators and deputies, as
well as the return journey as far as Filaret, passed
uneventfully; at the last-named station the train
crossed over to the loop line. The engine had the
tender in front.</p>

<p>"I looked out of the window and noticed that
the train was moving on to a line at Dealu-Spirei,
where a ballast train was already standing. I
sat down quickly and said to those who were
with me in the saloon-carriage: 'Sit down, there
is going to be a collision!' At the moment a
violent shock took place, throwing my companions
on to the floor; I was thrown in my armchair
against the table opposite. A second shock
threw me backwards, breaking the chair; my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
sword was bent round my knee and probably
caused the contusion, but unquestionably saved
my leg. Every one hastened to help me, but I
got up unaided and said a few reassuring words.
We had all blows about the head; Davila was
bleeding....</p>

<p>"The tender and the engine were both derailed
and ran into the sand. Three carriages of the
ballast train were destroyed and a couple of our
carriages were much damaged.... We were
about one mile from Cotroceni, and walked there
in spite of the heat.... Fortunately Elisabeth
first heard what had happened from my own
lips!"</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>.</h3>

<p>"God has clearly protected you! You can
imagine the tremendous play that imagination
possesses when so great a distance divides us....</p>

<p>"I know from experience how tedious injuries
to the shin bone are; on reckoning up my own
threefold experiences of that kind I find that I
spent a good six months' time on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaise
longue</i>!...</p>

<p>"I prefer to be silent about our policy&mdash;it is
most unpleasant for us that the Czar of Russia
should be hailed on all sides as the apostle of
peace. Radowitz is said to have conducted
himself passionately and without tact: his immediate
transfer to Athens is discussed. I congratulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
you on your successful elections; it is
quite clear that the longing for material development
has gained the upper hand over the empty
aims of the dreamers!"</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <small>THE SAME</small>.</h3>

<p>"The excitement over the Church struggle is
beginning to abate.</p>

<p>"The blunders of the Government and the
Ultramontane party mutually set each other off.
It is a pity that they are not confined to one
side, for then the crisis would be hastened to the
general benefit.</p>

<p>"I had an opportunity of going thoroughly
into these questions with the Emperor during
his visit here. He is inclined to a conciliatory
attitude, but is not sufficiently informed. I have
made him understand much, for which he was
grateful, and which he is the readier to believe
since I adhere to the basis of the May laws, but
condemn the petty method of carrying them out.
The Emperor was full of touching sympathy with
us, asked minutely after you, and was very well
pleased with the course of your policy."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THREATENING CLOUDS</h3>


<p class="noind">During the month of August 1875, the situation
in Eastern Europe suddenly assumed a
threatening aspect, through the outbreak of an
armed insurrection against the Turkish rule in
Herzegowina, actively supported by Servia, Montenegro,
and Bosnia, and countenanced (at any
rate in secret) by Russia. The Servians were
foremost in clamouring for war, hoping by the
prowess of their own army in the field of battle
and the assistance of Austria and Russia to shake
off finally the hated rule of the Sultan.</p>

<p>The oppressed and persecuted Christians of the
north-western portion of the Balkan peninsula had
watched the steady progress and constant development
of their brethren in Croatia, Servia, and
Montenegro with curious eyes, whilst they themselves
were still groaning under the heavy Ottoman
yoke. Nor, indeed, was this feeling of despair
and exasperation confined to the Christian inhabitants
alone, for the Bosnian Mohammedans, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
had hitherto fought for the Sultan and whose
ancestors, in order to retain their possessions, had
embraced Islam, now joined the Christian insurgents
in aiming at the separation of Bosnia and
Herzegowina from the Ottoman Empire. The
secret debates in the Servian Skuptschina resulted
in the presentation of two addresses to Prince
Milan, one advocating the proclamation of peace to
be published, the other offering him 3,000,000
ducats and an army of 40,000 men to support the
rebellion&mdash;to be kept secret. Montenegro was only
waiting for a signal from Servia before commencing
open hostilities.</p>

<p>The manifesto of the insurgents demanded the
autonomy of Bosnia and Herzegowina under a
Christian ruler; in return for this they pledged
themselves to recognise the suzerainty of the Porte
and to pay tribute in the same way as the other
vassal States of the Ottoman Empire. An attempt
by the Great Powers to maintain peace through
the mediation of their consuls failed owing to the
insurgents refusing to place any confidence in the
execution of the reforms promised by the Porte.</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>October 3rd, 1875</i>.</h3>

<p>"The disturbances in the Balkan peninsula,
though apparently quieted for the moment, are
still far from settlement. The insurrection is
making great secret progress and gathering force
like an avalanche. As the original motive was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
neither a political nor a national one, but merely a
rebellion against oppressive taxation from which
the Christian peasant hoped to free himself by
force of arms, peace will not be restored until
radical reforms put an end to the misrule of the
Pachas. Oriental Christians are thoroughly tired
of Turkish misgovernment, and but for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</i>
of the Northern Powers serious complications
would long ago have arisen. As it is, they are
only delayed; they certainly are not entirely done
away with. Diplomacy is incapable of solving the
Eastern Question; the East alone can solve it on
the field of battle by a combination of the nations
directly interested! Our present policy is to
await the advantage of events; the financial ruin
of Turkey will then aid us further.</p>

<p>"In Servia everything is topsy-turvy, and the
end will be either a war or a revolution. In any
case serious times are coming for us, and no one
knows when a clear insight into this muddle will
be obtained. For my own part, I want to gain
time in order to regulate various questions of
economy, such as the re-purchase of the railways;
I should also like to increase the military strength
of my country. Our new arms will not be
delivered before spring."</p>


<h3><i>From the</i> <span class="smcap">German Crown Prince</span>.</h3>

<p>"Matters are progressing slowly but surely in
the Empire. The German nation adheres to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Emperor and the Empire, whilst many Cabinets
only yield to force of circumstances. In South
Germany the Württemberg Army Corps has been
able to assimilate our principles so thoroughly that
it is almost on the level of a Prussian Corps. The
Bavarians, too, are very industrious, and take
great pains to bring their army organisation up to
our standard, in spite of certain hostile elements
whose aim it is to frustrate this object, and who
have succeeded in preventing Prussian instructors
from being sent there, and Bavarian soldiers from
coming to us to learn their work, which Württemberg
has done for the last eight years.</p>

<p>"I found your dear father as full of mental
vigour as ever, but, unfortunately, quite unable to
walk; on the other hand, he possesses remarkable
skill in managing his invalid chair, in which he
moves about the room without any assistance!
Your mother, brother, and sister seemed happy and
in good health, and the family circle was uncommonly
merry. A water-colour in your mother's
room greatly interested me; it represents you
handing the insignia of his office to a Metropolitan,
and you look like a Father of the Church yourself.
It seems to me that in your part of the world a
ruler has more influence in the appointment of the
high dignitaries of the Church than here&mdash;a truly
enviable state of affairs....</p>

<p>"I am enjoying these warm autumn days in
peace and quiet, after having drained the cup of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
inspections to the dregs. I am always willing to
fulfil my duties, but there are limits, especially
when one is no longer as young as one was. I had
to attend manœuvres in Württemberg, Bavaria,
Silesia, and Mecklenburg, and as these countries
do not exactly lie close together, I dashed from
one to the other by rail, like a state messenger.
Victoria and I spent six enjoyable weeks in the
spring in gorgeous Italy, just in time to reassure
the apprehensive political amateurs who were
excited by absurd rumours of war.</p>

<p>"William<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> is in the first form at the Cassel
Gymnasium. We think that the next two years,
while he is growing up, will be beneficial to his
development; he likes being there. Henry really
seems to be taken with the idea of a sailor's life;
we shall therefore soon have to prepare him
for this career."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The declaration of the agents of the guaranteeing
Powers that they would not protect Servia
from invasion unless the aggressive policy of the
Ristitch Ministry was abandoned led to the
fall of the Ministry towards the end of September.
This event was regretted by none except the
adherents of the <i>Red</i> Party, who, however,
retained the reins of power. A saying current
at the time made the following striking comparison:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
"Servia is peopled with Ministers, like
Roumania!"</p>


<h3><i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">German Crown Prince</span>, <i>October 22nd, 1875</i>.</h3>

<p>"Your kind letter was a source of real joy to
me. God's best gift to humanity is loyalty;
and I think He must have given you a double
measure. That we, who are separated from all
our loved ones for life, are doubly rejoiced to find
ourselves remembered, I need not tell you, nor
that your sympathy with our eternal regret has
comforted us. At this moment we are suffering
an unexpected and uncommon trial; Elisabeth
felt an ever increasing difficulty in walking this
summer, which we attributed to malaria, dampness,
and a tendency to rheumatism. For the
last few days she has remained in bed, lame in
both feet. I need not tell you how great is our
terror after the experiences of both our families!
The affair, however, has now taken a turn for the
better....</p>

<p>"I was greatly interested by what you wrote
about your children: so intelligent and simple an
education must certainly make them thorough in
every way. I find it hard to think of you surrounded
by such big sons....</p>

<p>"Great excitement prevails just now in Servia;
I think the young Prince is either steering
towards a war or a revolution! It is true at
present he is enjoying his honeymoon with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
pretty wife, who is closely related to all the great
families of Moldavia. The Servians would certainly
have preferred to see their ambition satisfied
by the choice of a 'real Princess' as a consort
for the Prince...."</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>November 27th, 1875</i>.</h3>

<p>"... So long as the suzerainty was merely
an empty form, restricted to the payment of
tribute or to impediments in affairs of treaties,
mints, and orders, Europe was justified in declining
to hear our complaints; but from the moment
that our dependence on the Porte hinders our
economical development, hampers our financial
reforms, and damages our credit, we can reasonably
demand that a sharp political line of demarcation
be drawn between an Empire which is
incapable of any reform and a flourishing young
State which has given Europe material guarantees
during the last few years! I recently had a conversation
on the subject with the Austrian representative,
who admitted that this was the correct
view of the situation, but that a precipitate step
might compromise the excellent position which
Roumania occupies to-day. I replied that, before
all else, I desired the preservation of peace, in
order to gain time for the execution of all necessary
reforms, the re-acquisition of the railways,
and the construction of connecting lines, and that
it was the business of the Great Powers to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
us a position which corresponded to the interest
and dignity of the country.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately the result of this Eastern
tangle cannot be foreseen. Do the three great
Northern Powers really desire peace? And will
they ever succeed in restoring peace? There are
too many factors to be taken into consideration;
Turkey seems to have been given up at last (in the
public opinion of Europe); even the English are
being forced to accustom themselves slowly to this
idea, which will certainly cost them much. When
once considerations for the Porte are abandoned,
the solution of the Eastern Question, which
frightens the diplomats of Europe, will be materially
simplified. Roumania is destined to become
the Belgium of the Lower Danube; why do the
Cabinet hesitate to declare this? We can wait;
but, as far as Europe is concerned, it would be a
guarantee of peace in the East.</p>

<p>"I opened the Chambers to-day with a short
and powerful speech from the throne, which I am
sure will make no unfavourable impression in
Europe. The disturbances in Herzegowina could
not be passed over in silence, but were mentioned
with such caution that public opinion cannot be
disquieted. Our relations with the Turks are
strained: they will not grant us even the smallest
concession; they actually refuse to concede us the
name Roumania; all this is to their own disadvantage....
Greece has begun to stir; deputations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
from Thessaly, Epirus, and Crete have
appeared in Athens, and their proposals have
been very favourably received. The aggrandisement
of Greece is the only salvation for that
unfortunate country."</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>December 1875</i>.</h3>

<p>"The Eastern Question will shortly be solved;
what could only have been expected to happen
in the course of years will have already come
to pass. The chief point is that France and
England have at length begun to realise that the
'sick man' can no longer be helped. Turkey
perishes through the financial ruin she has brought
upon herself! For the distant observer it is
interesting to note that the eyes of all are turned
towards Roumania, whose moderation is highly
appreciated everywhere. This moderation is the
only means by which Europe can be prepared for
the approaching independence of your country&mdash;an
independence which must be founded on the
belief of its necessity, and when it comes, must
come as a surprise to nobody. I congratulate you
on your political reserve and on the art of waiting,
the exercise of which you seem to have mastered
in opposition to the character of the Roumanian
nation. Precipitate action would be a great mistake,
and could not be excused, even were the
peace of the country at stake; the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Europe would discountenance Roumania if she
were to arouse a Continental war....</p>

<p>"I would willingly send the Crown Prince an
extract from your letter, but I must tell you that
he has at present no influence either on home
or on foreign policy, the direction of which lies
exclusively in the hands of the Chancellor.</p>

<p>"In this Eastern Question Germany only
occupies the third place after Russia and Austria;
but, when the decisive moment for weighing the
respective interests of those two States arrives,
you will find that Germany has reserved for
herself the option of placing her weight on that
side of the balance which seems most advantageous
to the development of the German
Empire...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The projected reforms, which were to place
Christians and Mohammedans on an equal footing&mdash;on
paper&mdash;were published by the Sublime
Porte in December, but failed to awaken much
appreciation either abroad or at home, where the
financial crisis assumed threatening proportions.
The Sultan's mind was at this time apparently
occupied chiefly by the idea that he had been
bewitched, and by constant demands for money,
regardless of the fact that his troops were dying
by thousands from cold and hunger in Herzegowina,
and that the salaries of all officials
remained months in arrear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the so-called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</i> of the Powers,
a strong rivalry was noticeable between Russia
and Austria, especially with regard to the eventual
attitude of Roumania.</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>February 8th, 1876</i>.</h3>

<p>"The Austrian representative inquires what
we shall do in the event of Russian troops
occupying the country; the Russian sounds us to
find out whether we repose any confidence in
Austria-Hungary; but both adjure us not to act
hastily. They desire peace, because they grudge
each other the solution of the Eastern Question,
and because neither is prepared for war. It
cannot be denied that we are suffering from this
indecision, and are exposed to every possible
danger. So much is certain, that Russia is
concentrating troops on the Moldavian frontier,
and that General Ignatieff declared to the Turkish
Ministers in the presence of my representative,
Prince Jean Ghika, that his Government would
seize the Danube Principalities as a pledge as
soon as the Turks occupied Servia and Montenegro!
It is, of course notorious that you cannot
weigh every word of the Russian Ambassador in
Constantinople in a goldsmith's scales; yet we
must not ignore these heedless comments....
We are resolved to repel with armed force any
occupation, no matter from which side it comes.
We naturally cannot hold out against a Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Power, yet we shall be able to preserve our
standing point without, as formerly, meeting the
army of occupation as our saviours....</p>

<p>"Matters are not progressing favourably in
Servia. The population of that portion of the
East has fixed its eyes on Montenegro, which
enjoys great authority amongst the Slavs, and
great respect from the Turks. Prince Nicholas,
with whom I am on the best terms, is treated
with especial consideration and leniency by
Russia and Austria, a thing which unfortunately
cannot be said of the young Milan."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On April 6, 1876, Prince Milan sent his uncle,
M. Catargiu, to inform Prince Charles that he
had decided on war with Turkey, and hoped that
Roumania would not remain content with the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of a passive spectator, as it was to the
interest of both countries to free themselves from
the Turkish suzerainty. Prince Charles, however,
did not abandon the strict reserve with which he
had hitherto received similar communications.</p>

<p>The startling news of a deficit of 30,000,000
francs, at a time when the political situation
rendered an increased expenditure on the army
essential, led on April 11, 1876, to the fall of the
Catargiu Ministry, which for five eventful and,
on the whole, prosperous years had assisted
Prince Charles in the consolidation of the Principalities.
General Floresku was entrusted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the formation of the new Cabinet, which, as it
included two other generals, was promptly dubbed
the "Cabinet of Generals" by the Opposition
Press. Strange to say, the life of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quasi</i>-military
government depended on the votes of
the eight bishops, as the supporters of the
Government disposed of thirty-seven, and the
Opposition thirty-four votes in the Senate.</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>April 26th, 1876</i>.</h3>

<p>"The greatest excitement prevails here, and
there are rumours of conspiracies and revolutions,
which do not, however, daunt me. I go straight
ahead and do my duty. My chief anxieties are
the condition of our finances and the serious
situation in the East.... Servia is in a state of
great agitation, and is driving with all sails set
towards war. I warned Prince Milan not to
expose his throne and country to danger by a
hasty step; but he declared that he could no
longer master the current, and had to choose
between a war and a revolution! Quite recently
I called upon him to delay taking action, and
informed him that he must not reckon on
Roumania, which would observe the strictest
neutrality. He received this exhortation in a
very bad humour."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yet another step towards the coming war was
the outbreak of a revolution in Bulgaria, where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
petition had been circulating for several weeks to
induce the Sultan to convert that Vilayet into a
constitutional kingdom. A <em>manifesto</em> was issued
by the secret National Government of Bulgaria
in Bucharest, calling all Bulgarians to arms, as
the hour of their liberation had arrived. This
<em>manifesto</em> was published broadcast throughout
the Bulgarian Vilayet, and met with enthusiastic
response everywhere.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the "Cabinet of Generals"
was forced to resign owing to its inherent weakness,
and a "Ministry of Conciliation," as Prince
Charles termed it, was formed by M. Jepureanu
on May 8, 1876.</p>

<p>Prince Charles welcomed the two Vice-Presidents
of the Senate, Prince Jon Ghika and
Demeter Sturdza, whom he had not seen for more
than five years, with a few friendly words on the
presentation of an address from the Senate on
May 14. A few days later the Prince expressed
his regret to M. Sturdza that he, whom he had
always trusted, should have adopted during the
past five years an anti-dynastic policy in personal
opposition to the Sovereign. The Roumanian
statesman replied that the only excuse he could
offer was that he had misunderstood the Prince's
motives, and thought that he had allowed himself
to be induced by the views of <em>one</em> party to
measures which would be of no benefit to the
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>From the</i> <span class="smcap">German Crown Prince</span>, <i>May 22nd, 1876</i>.</h3>

<p>"Ever since your last letter reached my hands
the rapt attention of Europe has been fixed on
Stamboul and the seething Turkish provinces.
This state of affairs reminds me of the time
before 1864, when every conversation about the
solution of the Schleswig-Holstein Question
ended thus: 'Let us wish the Danish King long
life, that the conflict may be delayed as long as
possible.' But Frederick VII. died suddenly, and
misfortune was at the doors. The situation to-day
is the more favourable in that none of the
Great Powers have any longing to fight, because,
God knows, enough blood has been shed these
last few years. So far as we Germans are concerned,
the Eastern Question possesses no immediate
interest for us: our only care is the
protection of our countrymen, on whose account
our iron-clad squadron is now manœuvring."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A revolution in the palace at Constantinople
resulted in the deposition of Abdul Aziz in favour
of Murad V. on May 30, 1876; but, though the
accession of the new Sovereign brought with
it plenty of promises of reform, the situation
remained as threatening as before. Almost every
day fresh reports of unheard-of cruelties and
massacres were received from Bulgaria, where
<i>bashi-bazouks</i> were suppressing the insurrection
with barbarous severity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The attitude of England now engrossed the
attention of Prince Charles, as the following
extracts will show:</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>June 9th, 1876</i>.</h3>

<p>"The most noteworthy incident of the present
day is the energetic awakening of England, which
has suddenly assumed, so to speak, a position 'on
guard,' and, relinquishing its passive attitude, is commencing
an aggressive policy against Russia. Should
this positive attitude of England secure the peace
of the world, she will deserve the highest appreciation;
but whether the future position of Roumania
will be bettered by it is quite another question!
The disclosure of the Russian aims, contained in
Ignatieff's proposals (if, indeed, they are the least
true), is very curious, and the gain to Roumania
by its elevation to a kingdom is very problematical.
The connection with the Porte is by no means as
heavy a burden as the supremacy of Russia!"</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>June 24th, 1876</i>.</h3>

<p>"The situation in Constantinople remains unaltered
by the change of rulers or the assassination<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
of the Ministers. The system of
corruption is so deeply rooted in every branch of
the Turkish administration that no Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
will ever succeed in exterminating it. The proposed
reforms are and will remain empty promises,
which gain no credit either with Mohammedans
or Christians. The insurrections will, therefore,
even in the most favourable circumstances, continue
to exist until the Ottoman Empire is shaken
to its foundations, if it is not overthrown entirely.
Smaller States will then arise, which will possess a
more or less protracted vitality.</p>

<p>"England has at last gauged the situation
correctly: Lord Derby's declaration in the Upper
House, maintaining that the Treaty of Paris only
guarantees the integrity of Turkey from attacks
from abroad, but that none of the signatory
Powers can intervene between the Porte and the
Tributary States, is most significant. If all the
Great Powers were to adopt this&mdash;the only correct
point of view&mdash;the Oriental conflict would be
localised, and we should thus avoid serious complications.
The vassal States and the various
Provinces must be allowed to break their horns.
If they succeed in emerging victorious from the
struggle with their suzerain, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant mieux</i>! If not,
they do not deserve to be independent countries.</p>

<p>"The Servians will not wait for the 'green-table'
decisions of diplomacy: they will decide
their fate themselves. Bulgaria is in a state of
great agitation; revolutionary committees have
been formed everywhere to incite the populace to
throw off the Turkish yoke. We are saddled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
with the thankless task of impeding the communications
of the committees here with those in
Bulgaria, and with preventing the invasion of
Turkey by armed bands. We had repeatedly to
act with energy, and arrest the leaders with their
troops; they were, of course, liberated in a couple
of days, but their weapons were seized.</p>

<p>"... Servia is ready for war, and inquiring
what will be the attitude of Roumania in the event
of Turkish warships steaming up the Danube?
The Servians, moreover, are not on the best of
terms with Roumania owing to our strictly
neutral attitude. Germany, on the other hand,
is convinced that the Turks, in spite of the condition
of their finances, are still capable of considerable
military efforts, and will annihilate the
Servians in a war; and she has, through the
medium of her agent, congratulated the Roumanian
Government on its attitude...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The insurgents in Herzegowina proclaimed the
Prince of Montenegro as their ruler, whilst the
Bosnians placed themselves under Prince Milan,
who now forwarded a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi-ultimatum</i> to the
Porte, demanding the incorporation of Bosnia in
the Principality of Servia under the suzerainty of
Turkey. Roumania seized the opportunity of
reminding the Sublime Porte of certain disputes
which still remained unsettled, in spite of the
loyalty shown by the Prince's Government to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
conventions. The following seven points were
then submitted to the Porte:</p>

<p>(1) The recognition of Roumania's individuality
as a State.</p>

<p>(2) The addition of the Roumanian Agent to the
Diplomatic Corps in Constantinople.</p>

<p>(3) The regulation of the position of Roumanians
in Turkey, and the recognition of Roumanian
consular jurisdiction over them.</p>

<p>(4) The recognition of the inviolability of Roumanian
territory.</p>

<p>(5) The conclusion of extradition, commercial,
and postal conventions between Turkey and
Roumania.</p>

<p>(6) The recognition of Roumanian passports.</p>

<p>(7) The definition of the Roumanian frontier at
the Delta of the Danube.</p>

<p>Servia declared war on June 30, 1876, followed a
couple of days later by Montenegro. The Servian
forces amounted to 56,000 men, concentrated on
the line Alexinatz and Deligrad, whilst Prince
Nicholas mustered 24,000 men, in addition to 4000
insurgents from Herzegowina. The Turkish force
consisted of 97,000 men, divided into four columns,
under Suleiman, Mehemed, Achmed and Osman
Pachas, the commander-in-chief being Abdul
Kerim. The fortune of war did not favour the
Servian insurgents under the Russian General
Tschernaiew, who were beaten near Babinaglawa
on July 9, and eventually forced to fall back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
behind the Servian frontier. The Montenegrin
troops, however, defeated Selim Pacha on the 16th
and 17th July, and compelled Moukhtar Pacha to
retire on Trebinje on the 29th. The course of the
war showed that the Servians had completely over-estimated
both their military spirit and their
material resources for war, and they were only
saved from annihilation by the intervention of the
Powers on their behalf in obtaining an armistice
for fourteen days, from September 16 to October 1.</p>

<p>In Roumania, in the meantime, a most inopportune
attack was made on the late Conservative
Government by the Radicals, who demanded a full
inquiry into the causes of the deficit, and the prosecution
of twelve former Ministers for the three
following offences:</p>

<p>(1) Violation of the Constitution and public
liberty.</p>

<p>(2) Extravagance in the expenditure of public
money.</p>

<p>(3) Abuse of power when in office.</p>

<p>The debates in the Chambers proved conclusively
that the Ministry was no longer able to stem
the tide of party passion; and on M. Jepureanu
handing in the resignation of the Cabinet on
August 4, 1876, M. Bratianu was entrusted with
the formation of the new Liberal Cabinet.</p>

<p>The reports of the <cite>Daily News</cite> about the "Bulgarian
Horrors," confirmed by Mr. Baring's report,
caused a complete revolution in the Turkophile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
sympathies of Great Britain. Mr. Baring stated
that fifty-four Bulgarian villages had been burnt
down, and about 10,000 people massacred; no less
than 2500 corpses were counted in Batak alone.
The English Secretary, however, pointed out that
the Bulgarians had also committed intolerable
outrages on the Mohammedan population, and took
considerable pains to expose Russian intrigues in
the Vilayet.</p>

<p>Yet another change of rulers took place in Constantinople
on August 31, 1876, when Abdul
Hamid succeeded his brother, who was no longer
responsible for his actions. The new potentate
wisely adopted many economies, and endeavoured
successfully to gain popularity with the army.</p>

<p>The situation, however, became more and more
serious, and a suggestion was received from St.
Petersburg that the Roumanian Government
should be sounded as to its attitude towards a
Russo-Turkish war. An evasive answer was sent,
to the effect that, whilst Roumania hoped for the
continuance of peace, her sympathies were with
the Bulgarians and all Christians who suffered
under the Turkish rule; the Principalities would
always value the friendship of Russia.</p>

<p>M. Cantacuzino, the Roumanian Agent in
Russia, reported that influential circles in Russia
were antagonistic to Roumania, because she had not
taken up a decided attitude towards the present
struggle. The whole of Russia, with the exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
of the Czar himself, was intent on war. Prince
Charles decided at once to send Bratianu and Col.
Slaniceanu (Minister of War) to Livadia, where
the Czar, the Czarewitch, Prince Gortchakoff,
and the Minister of War, Miliutin, had assembled.
On arrival at Livadia, M. Bratianu was immediately
pounced upon by Count Ignatieff to explain to him
the absolute necessity of an agreement regulating
the passage of the Russian army through Roumania.</p>

<p>Prince Gortschakow also referred to this
question, and suggested a non-political military
convention between the two countries. Bratianu
replied that no difficulties would ensue if the war
met with the approval of the guaranteeing Powers,
but that this consent must be clearly and definitely
expressed. The Russian Chancellor met
this opposition with the threat of treating
Moldavia and Wallachia as integral parts of the
Ottoman Empire, and therefore liable to invasion
without further parley. Bratianu, by no means
disconcerted, represented that Russia could hardly
commence the liberation of the Turkish Christians
by defeating a Christian army, and declared that
the Roumanian forces would oppose the passage of
the Prut by an invading force.</p>

<p>On parting, Prince Gortchakoff remarked: "We
shall soon come to terms if war ensues; and
Roumania can only gain by it!" To this Bratianu
replied that a complete understanding would
be in the interests of <em>both</em> States; and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
would willingly enter upon negotiations to that
effect.</p>

<p>The opinions of the Roumanian Ministers were
divided on this point; Bratianu considered an
understanding with Russia to be the best policy,
D. Sturdza advocated the strictest neutrality,
whilst Jonesku, the Foreign Minister, urged close
adherence to Great Britain.</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>October 16th, 1876</i>.</h3>

<p>"I heard to-day of the mobilisation of the
Roumanian army and its concentration in
Northern Moldavia! What is to be understood
by that? Is the march of the Russians through
the country to be opposed; or will Roumania side
with Russia? All this is not clear to me! The
pusillanimous policy of England has completely
entangled the whole Turkish-Christian Question.
Austria-Hungary is crippled by its dualism, the
German Empire is shrouded in aristocratic silence,
and only Russia perseveres with an iron persistence
in her far-reaching aims."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In reply to an <em>ultimatum</em> presented by General
Ignatieff, the Sublime Porte conceded an armistice
of two months, commencing on November
1, to apply to the Servian and Montenegrin
forces alike. Prince Milan's troops, under the
command of Tschernaiew, had suffered defeat
after defeat at the hands of the Turkish troops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and were again saved from annihilation only by
the direct intervention of Russia.</p>


<h3><i>From the</i> <span class="smcap">German Crown Prince</span>, <i>November 18th</i>.</h3>

<p>"... I received the following from Prince
Bismarck: 'The situation of the Prince is serious,
although I am not convinced that Russia will
proceed to war, if nobody endeavours to restrain
her from doing so.</p>

<p>"'In the event of war, I do not think Prince
Charles ought to resist the Russian proposals too
seriously, nor throw himself into their arms. It
would be best if he shielded himself behind his
duty towards the Porte, and then yielded to force,
which will probably be applied from the North
long before Turkey assumes the offensive.</p>

<p>"'He must not allow himself to be led away
by ambition, but must adhere to the treaties: his
resources are not sufficient in the face of two such
armies to secure him the respect of the victor, if
he employs his forces. So long as he adheres to
the treaties, he can always appeal to Europe.
That will always be a claim, though not perhaps
an indisputable one; still it will carry great weight
should the Russian campaign prove unfortunate
eventually. I offer my opinion here as if I were a
Roumanian, and not a German Minister, solely on
account of my personal interest for his Highness!'"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Six Russian Army Corps were mobilised and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
placed under the command of the Grand Duke
Nicholas, as the Army of the South, on November
14, 1876. A circular note to the Powers assigned
as the reason for this step the futility of all
diplomatic efforts to protect the Christians of
Turkey from the attacks of the Mohammedans.
The Czar, though desirous of peace, had therefore
mobilised a portion of his army, in order to obtain
guarantees for the execution of the principles
proposed by Europe.</p>

<p>M. de Nelidow arrived at Bucharest from
Constantinople on November 28, to negotiate
with the Roumanian Government about the
passage of the Russian army, and the possible
part which Roumania was to play in the war
with Turkey. The presence of the Russian agent
was naturally kept absolutely secret. Curiously
enough, a Turkish agent, Ali Bey, arrived on the
same day to arrange a combination with Roumania
against Russia. Prince Charles declined to meet
either of these messengers, and instructed his
Ministers to adopt a reserved attitude, and to
refer both to the Treaty of Paris.</p>

<p>Dem. Bratianu was sent to Constantinople in
November to put the Roumanian demands before
the Conference which had assembled there, and
to endeavour to arrange a peaceful settlement.
The Roumanian demands were: the recognition of
their neutrality; the regulation of their attitude
in the event of a war between Turkey and one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the Guaranteeing Powers; and the cession to
Roumania of a part of the Delta of the Danube.</p>

<p>The efforts of the Conference to avoid the war
came to a definite end on January 19, 1877, when
the Turkish Government declined every proposal
of the Conference as being opposed to the
"integrity, independence, and dignity of the
Empire."</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>January 20th, 1877</i>.</h3>

<p>"The hour of danger is approaching, and Roumania
will shortly be the scene of great political
and military events, which Europe will follow not
without agitation. In any case our position will
be difficult, as we shall be drawn into the complication
whether we wish it or no. Politicians
here are much more anxious about the result of a
Russo-Turkish conflict and the future of Roumania
than I am, as I have marked out my path from
the beginning:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> <em>to conclude a military convention
with Russia, and, if necessary, to fight with
Russia against the Turks</em>. It is true that opinion
here is much divided on this subject, and that
every effort is being made <em>to separate us from
Russia. There are Powers that demand that we
should protest against the entry of the Russians,
and that we should retire our army to Little
Wallachia!</em> You can imagine how I received such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
a suggestion! Andrassy, with whom I am on
friendly terms, is acquainted with my views on this
subject, and is not much edified by them. The
conflict with the Porte which the Constitution has
forced upon us was very welcome to me; Midhat
is endeavouring to allay it by every means; but
since we demand more to-day than he has the
courage to give us, it is still an open question.
The Turks are concentrating considerable forces in
Bulgaria, and are arming the Danubian fortresses,
which are in a miserable condition, with feverish
haste; the heavy guns are being brought up from
the arsenal at Constantinople and mounted in the
forts, with much expenditure of trouble, labour
and money. All sorts of rumours are spread
abroad about the unsatisfactory condition of the
Russian army, but my information shows that it
is ready for action, and certainly equal to its
opponent.... It is much to be regretted that
Servia can take no part in the war; it is only with
the greatest exertion that a corps of 15,000 men
can be assembled, and they would assuredly show
no enthusiasm."</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>January 22nd, 1877</i>.</h3>

<p>"On looking back over recent events the conviction
is borne in upon me that the fear which
the Russian Colossus inspires in Europe, coupled
with the natural differences in the interests of
the Powers, have been the causes of the pitiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
end of the Congresses which started with such a
flourish of trumpets. Had Europe been united and
less timorous, it might have intervened and begun
those Conferences at the time of the Servian
War, instead of a whole year later. Turkey could
hardly have resisted if a pressure of all the
Powers had been applied at that time even without
Russia, and she would have conceded more
than she can now afford to do after her unquestionable
successes in the Servian War and
the complete change in her interior economy.
So much is certain after a long and anxious
period that the Conferences have resulted in
a fiasco, and that this fiasco has materially raised
and strengthened the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</i> and authority of
the Porte.... Roumania will be most deeply
affected by such a war, as the Russian base
of operations can only be Roumania; there is
no other at her disposal. Resistance to Russia
is out of the question; you must therefore
endeavour to reap the greatest possible benefits
from this impossibility. The material advantages
develop spontaneously, for the acquisition
of money and the increased value of all country
produce will assume enormous dimensions; the
political benefits are, however, more difficult to
formulate. The permission to march through
Roumanian territory, and the establishment
there of all that an army on an active footing
requires, is already half a declaration of war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
from Roumania to Turkey. The latter, however,
must recognise that Roumania cannot prevent
the entry of two or three hundred thousand
Russians; the only question that remains is
whether Roumania will co-operate with the
advance of the Russian army and cross the
Danube. I should consider this most unwise,
for in doing so Roumania will place herself
between two stools. If the Turks preserve their
proverbial powers of resistance, and so protract
the war to an indefinite and costly length, we
have no guarantee that the Russians would not
conclude peace with the Turks in one way or
another and abandon Roumania, who would then
be overwhelmed by Turkish malevolence.</p>

<p>"It is more than probable that both sides will
soon become exhausted in a localised war; the
only question is, which of the two will give in
first. Russia's eyes will always be fixed on her
own interests, never on those of Roumania; and,
since there is no such thing as gratitude in
politics, I recommend you to exercise the utmost
caution.</p>

<p>"Europe will not interest itself in a defeated
and fallen Roumania&mdash;it will only have regard for
a free country which is not tied down by treaties.
Prudence and moderation are therefore necessary
at so critical a period, which will either prove to
be a wholesome era of transition for your country,
or will bear the seeds of its annihilation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>The efforts of the Russian diplomats in Constantinople
now appeared to be confined to delaying
the advance of the Russian army until a
more favourable season of the year should have
arrived. Prince Charles Anthony thus sketched
the possible results of the coming war in a letter
to his son dated March 1, 1877:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Russia will hardly gain great triumphs&mdash;a few
military successes may be achieved, but certainly
none of any political importance. The army and
the Slav element must content themselves with a
small modicum of glory, whilst the Czar Alexander
may think himself lucky in returning to
peaceful and normal circumstances, and in having
mastered a movement which is of the greatest
danger to Russia. The only tangible result of
the whole Russian initiative will, perhaps, be that
the suzerainty of the Porte over Roumania is
transferred to Russia.</p>

<p>"Roumania would thereby be supported by a
stronger and more stable Power, with, perhaps,
more freedom at home and abroad, but would
certainly not achieve her longed-for recognition as
an independent and equal State.</p>

<p>"The forms of the suzerainty would perhaps be
more equable and more pleasant, but the dependence,
though tolerable, would always be felt.</p>

<p>"This would merely be an exchange of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôles</i>.
Europe would then admire Russia's moderation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and would doubtless concede every demand made
along the lines I have suggested. The sacrifice of
Roumania would thus be a message of peace, on
which would hinge the return to the universal
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>A final attempt to settle the Eastern Question
by means of the London Protocol met with as
little success as the efforts of the Conference; and
the Russo-Roumanian Convention was signed on
April 16, 1877, by Baron Stuart on behalf of the
Czar, and M. Cogalniceanu on behalf of Prince
Charles. The following were the chief articles of
the Convention:</p>

<p>(1) The Russian army to be granted a free
passage through Roumania, the Russian Government
paying all expenses connected therewith.</p>

<p>(2) The Government of the Czar pledges itself
to maintain and protect the actual integrity and
political rights of Roumania.</p>

<p>(3) The special regulations as to the march of
the Russian troops to form the subject of a special
treaty.</p>

<p>(4) The Roumanian Government to obtain the
ratification required by the Constitution, and to
proceed at once to the execution of the stipulations
of the treaty.</p>

<p>The Turkish reinforcements of the forces at
Rustchuk and Schumla caused the greatest
excitement in Bucharest, indeed in the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Roumania. Public opinion, influenced perhaps by
the recent failure of the Servian army in the field,
declined to place any confidence in the military
efficiency of the Roumanian troops. The incessant
and exaggerated rumours of Turkish raids and
passages of the Danube created something like a
panic in the capital, and several over-anxious
inhabitants quitted the country rather than run
the risk of experiencing the horrors of a Turkish
invasion. Prince Charles, however, had every
trust and confidence in the ability of his army to
prevent the Turks from crossing the Danube.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE ARMY</h3>


<p class="noind">By no means the least of the Prince's tasks was
the reorganisation and training of the Roumanian
army, which at the time of his accession was in
the most deplorable condition. Moulded on the
pattern of the French army of 1859, and trained by
a French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mission militaire</i>, it reproduced many of
the defects of the army, which failed so utterly in
1870, and yet missed those qualities which saved
the Imperial army of France from dishonour in
the field. The young Prince was fully aware of the
potent influence for good that a well-disciplined
army exerts upon the welfare of a nation, and
determined from the first to employ the highest
moral and material resources of his country to
establish an army which, if not formidable in numbers,
should at least be worthy of respect in point
of quality. His nine years' service in the Prussian
artillery and cavalry had given him a thorough
knowledge of the minutiæ of military routine and
discipline, whilst his active service on the staff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
of the Crown Prince in 1864, and his familiar
intercourse with the leaders of the Prussian army
had helped to train him in the art of command.
Prince Charles realised that a weak State like
Roumania, surrounded by its powerful neighbours,
Russia, Austria, and Turkey, must place its army,
on a thoroughly satisfactory footing, unless it were
content to play the unsatisfactory part of being
forced to side, possibly against its will, with whatever
State was first to mobilise its forces, whilst
its very weakness might be the cause of a war.
The safety and welfare of Roumania, he was
firmly convinced, rested on a sound military constitution,
by means of which its independence
would some day be achieved on the field of battle.
No pains, therefore, and no exertions were too
great to devote to the training of his troops, who
soon learnt to look up to him as their example in
all that a soldier should be. His absolute impartiality
and justice, his care for their well-being,
and his knowledge of every detail of warfare,
made him as popular with his officers as with his
men.</p>

<p>From the outset Prince Charles endeavoured
to mould the spirit of his officers on that to which
he had been accustomed in Prussia. Shortly
after his accession, he received a round robin
from the officers of the army, desiring that those
officers who had taken part in the Revolution of
February 23, 1866, should be dismissed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
army. Prince Charles received the deputation in
the Palace and addressed them as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have accepted your address, first, because
I respect the feeling which has dictated this step;
and secondly, that I might have an occasion of
informing you of my views upon military honour
and the duties of a soldier.</p>

<p>"An address is apt to assume the appearance
of moral pressure, such as no soldier can be permitted
to exercise over the supreme head of the
army.</p>

<p>"The soldier's oath demands absolute obedience.
Neither the acts of the head of the army, nor the
motives which lead to them, admit of criticism;
politics must have no influence on the soldier,
whose sole duty it is to defend with his last breath
his Sovereign and his country against every enemy.</p>

<p>"I am fully convinced that you share my views,
and recognise that your action is from every military
standpoint inadmissible. It is on that
account that I desire you to trust to my military
judgment, and to leave to me to act in all that
concerns the army according to my own conviction
and sense of duty.</p>

<p>"At the same time, I repeat, I appreciate the
honourable feeling on which this address is based;
but I also again urge that I demand at all times
devotion and unreserved obedience from each one
of you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been and am still a soldier by inclination;
and it is for that reason, as well as on
account of the importance to the country of a
well-disciplined army, that one of my most
cherished aims will be to secure for it the position
to which it has every right to aspire. I shall
endeavour to become well acquainted with the
army and its leaders, that I may be able to decide
according to merit and justice, by utterly rejecting
all party or personal interest.</p>

<p>"Reckon confidently on this promise, and remember
that I have come to create a future, and
not to rely upon the precedents of a past which I
ignore, and of which I would even prefer to
remain ignorant."</p></blockquote>

<p>The spirit of insubordination was even more
rife amongst the National Guard, as the following
incident will show. Prince Charles ordered the
National Guard of Bucharest to assemble at the
parade-ground of Cotroceni on July 2, 1866. The
President of the Ministry reported to the Prince
the day before that the National Guard would
refuse to muster as ordered, as a rumour had
gained currency that they were to be disarmed on
account of their party tendencies. They intended,
therefore, to parade before the Chamber, and invoke
the protection of the Deputies against such
a step. The Prince, however, refused to change
his order, and insisted upon its execution. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
arriving at Cotroceni the following day, he found
that only a couple of hundred men had assembled
there. An aide-de-camp was at once despatched
to Bucharest to enforce the order, whilst Prince
Charles set himself at the head of those present
and marched with bands playing into the capital.
Companies then appeared from all sides, until
some three thousand men were collected on the
Theatre Square. The Guard then marched past
and cheered their Sovereign again and again,
though their behaviour had given him every
reason to consider them an element of danger
rather than of safety to the State.</p>

<p>The projected army reforms were hampered at
every turn by the want of money; on one occasion
the Prince was even obliged to advance money
out of his private purse for the purchase of two
batteries of rifled guns from Krupp's factory.</p>

<p>The strength of the army, which the Sublime
Porte had limited to 30,000 men, was to be organised
into a standing force of 20,000 with a reserve
of 10,000 men; whilst a Militia of 30,000 and
a Landsturm of 50,000 were to be instituted.
Every Roumanian who was fit for service was
liable to serve from the ages of twenty to forty in
one or the other category. Though the total
number of men available thus amounted to over
100,000, the great bulk remained untrained,
and of very little value for service in the field.
The frequent reviews and inspections which Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Charles initiated proved that the troops lacked
cohesion, and their officers the ability to lead
their men in accordance with the principles of
modern warfare.</p>

<p>The first attempt at practical and systematic
manœuvres for the Roumanian troops took place
near Cotroceni on October 14 and 15, 1867, when
the garrison of Bucharest, consisting of five
battalions, three batteries of four guns each, and
one regiment of cavalry, practised the three phases
of an engagement. The operations were directed
by the Prince in person, who also bivouacked with
his troops after a march of about twenty-two miles.
The march back to Bucharest the following day
gave an opportunity for skirmishing and manœuvring.
Before entering the town Prince Charles
assembled the superior officers, and pointed out
the great want of training displayed, and how
much remained to be done before the army could
be fit to take the field; he did not, however, forget
to mention that the officers had hitherto had but
little opportunity to practise themselves in leading
their men, and none at all in handling a force of
the three arms at manœuvres.</p>

<p>On the occasion of these first manœuvres a
number of officers received special promotion, but
considerable excitement was caused by this step,
as two of them were not on the best of terms with
the Ministry. The Minister of War also complained
that his opinion was not asked before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
promotions took place. Prince Charles, however,
exercised the right of promotion intentionally in
order to make good several cases of injustice which
had arisen from party feeling. The effect of this
independent action on the army was excellent, as
it was clearly seen that from henceforth the army
would not be affected by the influence of the
political party of the day.</p>

<p>The rifle selected by Prince Charles for the rearmament
of his infantry was the celebrated needle-gun
of Prussia, 5000 of which were to be delivered
in March 1868, to be followed by another 15,000
during the course of the year. The ready aid
offered by King William to Prince Charles was
promptly recognised by the Roumanians: "The
Prussians have sent us their best, whilst the French
send us what they have cast off."</p>

<p>Even in the matter of uniform the Prince insisted
rather on utility than show. The heavy
gold lace of the officers was abolished; the
infantry received blue tunics (the artillery brown
tunics), grey trousers, and greatcoats; the cavalry
were clothed as Hussars instead of as Lancers.</p>

<p>The degrading corporal punishment of the
bastinado was abolished by a letter from Prince
Charles to the Minister of War, dated May 21,
1868, and published in the official <cite>Moniteur</cite>.
Prince Charles retorted to the increasing interference
of the foreign Powers in Roumanian affairs
with a redoubled zeal for the improvement of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
army, and hoped to raise the feeling of military
honour among his troops by abolishing so barbarous
a punishment.</p>

<p>Another organisation for the army was passed
by the Chamber on June 13, 1868, according to
which the following five classes were to be created
for the defence of the country:</p>

<p>(1) The Standing Army and its Reserve.</p>

<p>(2) The Active Militia (Dorobanz and Frontier Battalions).</p>

<p>(3) The Sedentary Militia.</p>

<p>(4) The Citizen Guard, and</p>

<p>(5) The Landsturm.</p>

<p>Service in the first category was to consist of
three years with the colours and four in the
reserve; only a third of the second category was
to serve with the colours whilst the remainder
were allowed furloughs; the third class only were
called upon during a war; the fourth was of no
military importance, as it was formed from the
census classes, and permitted to elect its own
officers; while the fifth comprised the whole male
population from the age of seventeen to fifty not
included in the former categories. This important
increase in the armed strength of the nation was
achieved at the trifling cost of £192,000, the total
vote for the army amounting to £320,000.</p>

<p>The 8th Infantry Regiment was raised on
August 18, 1868, when the existing Line Regiments
received their 3rd battalions, and no less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
than thirty-three Militia battalions were also to be
organised. One hundred and fifty non-commissioned
officers were promoted to fill the vacancies
caused by this increase to the army.</p>

<p>A tradition had arisen in Roumania that the
Minister of War was ex-officio Commander-in-Chief
of the army, and this led to the political
fluctuations and struggles being transplanted to
the army itself. Prince Charles, therefore, appointed
a civilian, Bratianu, Minister of War, to
show that the Command in Chief was vested in
the person of the Sovereign, thereby enabling the
army to devote itself to its work of preparation
for war without becoming involved in the politics
of the day.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel von Krenski, of the Prussian
army, arrived on October 8, 1868, to assist the
Prince in his work of reorganisation; this step
caused the greatest excitement in French official
circles, where the absurd rumour gained ground
that 6000 Prussian soldiers had found their way
into Roumania in disguise! The French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mission
militaire</i>, under Colonel Lamy, was thereupon
withdrawn, and a formal crusade against Colonel
Krenski, the "representative of this foreign
policy," was set in motion. On his return to
Berlin the gallant Colonel was greeted with the
pointed remark from his General that his mission
to Bucharest had caused more correspondence than
all the North German forces put together!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Charles determined to establish a standing
camp of instruction for his troops, and finally
settled on Furceni, in Moldavia, on the left bank
of the Seret, where plenty of wood for huts was
available. The regiments moved into camp in
succession, commencing in April 1869. In a
letter to his father the Prince alludes to his camp
life as follows: "I am fairly well satisfied with
my stay in camp. The troops are capitally housed
in the barracks they have built themselves. The
situation is fairly healthy, as proved by the
number of sick&mdash;200 out of 12,000 men; whilst at
Bucharest the proportion is 230 to 3000. Those
troops whose barracks are not completed remain
under canvas. On my arrival I found seven Line
Regiments, four Rifle and two Engineer battalions,
the 2nd Artillery Regiment, one squadron
of gendarmes, and two of Dorobanz Cavalry, in
addition to the Train, Sanitary, and Supply
Departments. I inspected a regiment every day,
and lunched with the officers of the various corps....
Both officers and men like the camp, and the
prevailing spirit is excellent. I promise myself
favourable results from camp life, especially with
regard to discipline and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>."... On
his return from Livadia the Prince attended the
manœuvres before closing the camp, and noticed
a very marked progress, especially on the occasion
of the passage of the river Seret being forced.</p>

<p>The following year, 1870, Prince Charles demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
an even higher standard of efficiency at
his inspections, as the troops had had ample time
to become acquainted with their new drill and
regulations. Though the spirit of the regulars
and militia left little to be desired, the National
Guard repeatedly proved their worthlessness and
want of reliability, especially during the excitement
of elections at Plojeschti, where the local
National Guard had to be disbanded.</p>

<p>Some slight changes in organisation took place
in April 1871, when the term of service with the
colours was increased to four years. The Dorobanz
and Frontier units were now formed into a
Territorial Army, the infantry of which was now
termed "Dorobanzi," and the cavalry "Calaraschi,"
the cavalry of the Line being named
"Roschiori." The Fire Brigades, hitherto organised
in companies and battalions, now formed part
of the Territorial Army, and were trained as
gunners.</p>

<p>Prince Charles made the acquaintance of Colonel
Charles Gordon, who was then a member of the
European Commission, on April 20, 1872. The
conversation turned chiefly on military matters,
particularly the great strategical value of Galatz,
which Gordon declared could easily be made into
a strong fortress, as its position between the
Danube, the Prut, and the Seret would only
render necessary works against the approaches
from the north. Colonel Gordon created a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
favourable impression upon the Prince, who showed
the greatest interest in his many war services in
the Crimea and in China.</p>

<p>A Roumanian military decoration for long and
loyal service for officers was founded in June 1872,
in silver for eighteen, and in gold for twenty-five
years' service. The oval medal was to be worn
with a blue ribbon, bordered with yellow. A
similar medal in silver, to which a pension of
300 francs was added, was struck for the benefit
of non-commissioned officers who had served as
such with credit for twelve years.</p>

<p>Late in September 1872, 11,000 men were
assembled in a bivouac at Baneassa, north of
Bucharest, to take part in manœuvres near Tirgoveschte.
A series of engagements was practised
over a deeply intersected and wooded country,
and gave the artillery in particular an opportunity
of distinguishing itself. At the close of the
exercises Prince Charles presented the first
medals for good conduct to a number of deserving
non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>In reply to the Prince's inquiry as to the best
method of spending the 8,000,000 francs voted by
the Chamber for either barracks or fortifications,
Count von Moltke replied, in the spring of 1874,
that he could not understand the Roumanian
desire for a large standing army, as a peace
strength of 10,000 men, to be increased to 25,000
men in war, would be ample, as their only task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
was to maintain order at home. Roumania was in
the happy situation of not requiring an army at
all, and could employ the vast sums which military
establishments required elsewhere in furthering the
progress of the country. "How happy should we
be, if we were not forced to keep up so large an
army, and could employ the hundreds of millions
for other purposes!" He declared, on the other
hand, that a Landwehr system would be of excellent
service in educating and disciplining the nation.</p>

<p>A longer report from the General Staff advocated
the contrary view: "In the event of a war
with Turkey it would appear most suitable for the
Roumanian army to concentrate at Bucharest or
near the Danube, to oppose invasion at that point,
and to stop or delay the hostile advance.</p>

<p>"Turkey will make use of the Varna-Rustchuk
railway to effect the concentration of her forces,
and will attempt to cross the Danube near
Rustchuk, making Bucharest her first objective....
If the Roumanian army is assembled at the
commencement of the war in a fortified camp near
the Carpathians instead of near the Danube, it
might easily happen that the enemy would
seize the opportunity of raiding the exposed
capital....</p>

<p>"It would be better to avoid delusion and the
expenditure of large sums on projects from which
the country can expect neither safety nor utility.
The army is the support of the State, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Roumania, where so many possibilities have to be
considered, the training and care of the army is
of paramount importance."</p>

<p>The manœuvres of 1874 were attended by
Russian, Austrian, Prussian, Servian, Dutch, and
English officers. The First Division was to force
the passage of the Buseu River and occupy the
town of Buseu, which the Second Division was to
defend. The leading of the troops on the first day,
however, was not very satisfactory, and Prince
Charles was forced to speak very plainly at the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">critique</i>. But the operations of the following days
gave great satisfaction, and Colonel Asis Bey remarked
to Colonel Morris: "This is serious. I
had not expected so much!" At the conclusion
of the manœuvres Prince Charles presented thirty-two
colours and standards to various regiments, and
afterwards reviewed the troops. Colonel Morris,
in replying to a toast given at a gala-dinner the
same evening, remarked: "All that I have seen
of this young army has filled me with astonishment,
and I shall report to my Government how
Roumania has progressed." Prince Charles wrote
his father the following account of the incident:
"I thanked him for his praises, and said that,
coming from the mouth of an Englishman, they
possessed especial value, as his countrymen were
in absolute ignorance of the state of our affairs....
The Turk remarked to the Englishman that it
would be best to give Roumania her independence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and to conclude a treaty of alliance with it. Most
significant!"</p>

<p>The threatening situation in Eastern Europe in
October 1876 led to a partial concentration of
the Roumanian army in anticipation of the
mobilisation order, which it was felt could not be
long delayed. Four Divisions were made up to
their war strength to take part in manœuvres,
and at the same time to be ready to meet any
eventuality. A report from the Minister of War
showed that only 25,000 Peabody rifles with
insufficient ammunition were available. Prince
Charles wisely insisted that the First and Second
Division should be armed with this rifle, and the
Third and Fourth should receive the now practically
obsolete needle-gun. The greatest activity
prevailed in the War Office, and eight new Dorobanz
Regiments of two battalions each were raised
at once.</p>

<p>The unceasing care with which Prince Charles
had watched the training of his army in peace was
to bear its fruit in the great war which now ensued.
The Roumanian troops proved that, though they
lacked the glorious traditions of the older armies,
they were fully their equals in discipline, courage,
and endurance; and they more than justified the
confidence which their Prince placed in them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE WAR WITH TURKEY</h3>


<p class="noind">The long-expected declaration of war between
Russia and Turkey took place on April 23, 1877,
accompanied by a proclamation to the Roumanian
nation from the Grand Duke Nicholas, announcing
his intention of entering their territory in the hope
of finding the same welcome as in the former wars.
A special sitting of the Chamber assembled on the
26th of the same month to confirm the Convention
with Russia; and a council of war held the same
evening decided to occupy the line of the Sabar,
to reinforce the troops on the Danube, and to
garrison Calafat, as the precipitate advance of the
Russians, coupled with the assent of the Chamber
to the Convention, rendered Roumania liable to a
Turkish invasion. The question now to be solved
was whether the Roumanian army under Prince
Charles was to take an active share in the campaign,
and, if so, on what terms. It was, however,
eventually decided to remain passive for the
present, though the Grand Duke seemed anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to draw Prince Charles into co-operation with the
Russian army. The mobilised Roumanian troops
were organised as follows, under the supreme
command of Prince Charles, with Colonel Slaniceanu
as Chief of his Staff:</p>


<p><span class="smcap">First Army Corps</span>: General Lupu.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">First Division, Colonel Cerchez: 2 brigades, 1 cavalry
brigade, 3 batteries.</p>

<p class="hanging">Second Division, Colonel Logadi: 2 brigades, 1 cavalry
brigade, 3 batteries.</p>

<p class="hanging">Corps Artillery&mdash;6 batteries.</p></blockquote>


<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Second Army Corps</span>: General Radovici.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Third Division, Colonel Angelesbu: 2 brigades, 1 cavalry
brigade, 3 batteries.</p>

<p class="hanging">Fourth Division, General Manu: 2 brigades, 1 cavalry
brigade, 3 batteries.</p>

<p class="hanging">Corps Artillery&mdash;6 batteries.</p></blockquote>

<p>The total strength of the army amounted to
50,000 men with 180 guns, with a reserve of
about 70,000 men of the National Guard and
Militia.</p>

<p>An important resolution, adopted by the
Chamber on May 11, 1877, declared that a state
of war existed with Turkey, and expressed confidence
in the justice of the Powers, authorising
the Government to use every endeavour to obtain
the recognition of Roumanian independence at the
close of the war. The desire of the Russian
Commander-in-Chief for the assistance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Roumanian army found frequent expression even
in these days. At an interview at Plojeschti
the Grand Duke demanded active support from
Prince Charles, as he felt convinced that his own
force was not sufficient to cope with its task, and
added that at the first council of war he had asked
for reinforcements amounting to another three
or four Army Corps. The least he expected was
that Prince Charles would hold the left bank of
the Danube until the Russians had finished their
strategical deployment.</p>

<p>Prince Charles replied that he intended to keep
his troops under his own command, but that the
Russians would be benefited by having their
right flank secured. The Roumanian garrisons
of Oltenitza and Giurgiu would not retire until
relieved by Russian troops. At the same time he
declared himself anxious to take an active part in
the war, but only on condition that his proposals
were agreed to.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke returned the Prince's visit on
the following day, May 15, accompanied by his
son and a numerous suite, which included M.
de Nelidow, who had conducted the negotiations
with Roumania, and was now in charge of the
diplomatic correspondence at headquarters.</p>

<p>In reply to an inquiry in the Chamber on
May 21, Cogalniceanu declared that Roumania was
practically independent, as Europe would not
force her to return to her former bondage. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
was then decided by a large majority to create an
order, "The Star of Roumania," as the first act of
Roumanian independence. This order consists of
five classes&mdash;viz., Knight, Officer, Commander,
Grand Officer, and Grand Cross,&mdash;whose members
wear a star of eight rays depending from a crown
and surcharged with a cross in blue enamel, which
displays the eagle of Wallachia. The ribbon is
red, bordered with blue, and the motto runs: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In
fide salus</i>.</p>

<p>Prince Charles Anthony entirely agreed with
his son's attitude towards Russia, and stigmatised
the mooted co-operation, with its inevitable
subordination and incorporation in the Russian
army, as a "political <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</i>."</p>

<p>"The <em>possibility of a Russian defeat</em>," he wrote,
"no matter how improbable, must also be considered:
an untouched reserve on this side of the
Danube, which could only consist of the Roumanian
army intact, would in that case possess an
immense importance!"</p>

<p>Prince Charles, accompanied by his Staff, set
out on the 27th to inspect his troops at Crajowa
and Calafat, and found them in excellent order and
discipline. At 7 <small>P.M.</small> the Prince ordered the
bombardment of Widin to commence, and a lively
cannonade ensued, during which three Turkish
shells exploded in the immediate neighbourhood of
the Prince. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sangfroid</i> of their ruler did
not fail to arouse a feeling of appreciation in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Roumanian nation, who on his return greeted him
everywhere with indescribable enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The Czar in the meantime declared that, if the
Roumanian Government wished to take part in
the campaign, it must do so at its own expense
and risk, and must, moreover, place the army
under the command of the Grand Duke. "Russia
has <em>no need</em> of the support of the Roumanian
army. The force which has been put into the
field against Turkey <em>is more than sufficient</em> to
achieve the high object which the Czar had in
view in commencing the present war."</p>

<p>Prince Charles attended a council of war at the
Russian headquarters in Plojeschti on June 1, 1877,
and, whilst discussing the advance into Bulgaria,
casually pointed out the strategic importance of
the junction of the roads at Plevna. The Grand
Duke urged the Prince to cross the Danube near
Widin as soon as possible, but Prince Charles was
unable to comply with this request until the
material necessary for bridges had been collected.</p>

<p>The Czar arrived at Plojeschti a few days later
with a suite of over 700 persons, amongst them
Prince Alexander of Battenberg, then a subaltern
in the Hessian Dragoons. In a private interview
with Prince Charles the Czar expressed his intention
of lending Roumania, which already owed so
much to Russia, a helping hand, but declined to
enter into the vexed question of Roumanian co-operation
in the war. A curious incident occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
during the Czar's return visit to Bucharest, when
a large bouquet, thrown from a house, fell close
by his carriage. The Czar started back, fearing
a bomb, and only the ready tact of Princess
Elisabeth covered his confusion.</p>

<p>An important conversation took place between
Prince Charles and Gortchakoff, who definitely
expressed the opinion that, though the Delta of
the Danube was essential for the development of
Roumania, Russia wants one of its arms, the Kilia.
The Prince declared that his first object was to
preserve the integrity of his country, and that
any extension of the frontier after the war would
be only a secondary consideration. Gortchakoff
appeared to be firmly of opinion that the war
would be short and glorious. He could not, therefore,
agree with the openly expressed wish of the
Headquarters Staff for the co-operation of the
Roumanian army.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The reports of the first
engagements did not, however, fully bear out
this belief; for, though successful at other points,
the Russians were beaten in Asia at Bajaset, and
were forced to withdraw from that town, whilst
Mukhtar Pacha compelled General Tergukassoff
to retire to Igdir.</p>


<h3>"<i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>June 11th, 1877</i>.</h3>

<p>"At last the situation has somewhat cleared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and the presence of the Czar under existing
conditions may possibly be an important starting-point
for future developments. The declaration
of independence is perfectly justified; it
is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>, which must, in any case,
be reckoned with hereafter. At the time this
declaration took place, four weeks ago, I feared
a considerable increase of the complications already
existing, and could hardly become reconciled to it.
However, I always remembered that your course
of action must be based on motives of which we
must be ignorant. Your wisdom in seizing the
right moment is again confirmed. The foreign
Press, although extremely surprised, has become
more or less reconciled to the altered situation,
and even the English papers have bridled themselves
with decency....</p>

<p>"In my opinion the material military successes
of the Russians will be in Asia; the moral successes
in Europe; and the conception of a moral
victory is so elastic that I see no reason why the
war should be prolonged beyond reasonable limits.</p>

<p>"The creation of a united State&mdash;Roumania-Bulgaria&mdash;of
course with the freedom of the
Danube to the sea, would be a magnificent creative
idea, only the deep-seated difference of the
nationalities gives rise to weighty considerations."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On June 28, 1877, the Grand Duke arrived at
Simnitza, where the Fourteenth Division had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
collected a number of boats preparatory to effecting
a crossing, aided by a vigorous cannonade the
day before along the whole line of the Danube.
The Volhynian Regiment embarked at 2 <small>A.M.</small>
in absolute silence, and had barely landed when
an alarm shot was fired. A short engagement
terminated in the retreat of the Turkish force,
and, in spite of hostile fire from the artillery,
General Dragomirow succeeded in assembling
the whole of his Division on the farther bank of
the river, with the loss of about 30 officers and
700 men. The construction of a bridge was
commenced from both banks simultaneously,
though several sections were destroyed by a
sudden storm. The bridge at Braila remained
intact, and was crossed by Prince Charles on foot
the following day.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that Roumania had
so far taken but a small share in the campaign,
Prince Charles was able to supply the Russian
headquarters with trustworthy information about
the enemy's movements, especially with regard
to the garrison of Widin, under Osman Pacha,
who was now reported to be on the march to
Rahova with fifteen battalions and two batteries.
Though an advanced party of Cossacks seized
Plevna on July 8, they were unable to retain
possession of that town, a couple of Turkish
battalions from Nikopoli forcing them to retire on
the following day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Charles now quitted Schimnik to rejoin
his headquarters at Pojana, near Calafat, where
he was better able to superintend the movements
of his army. In a letter to the Princess he
alludes to the Russian estimate of his army as
follows: "The Russians do not want to recognise
the services we have rendered them; Grand Duke
Nicholas has sent a long report to the Czar,
dealing with the course of events from the
beginning of the war to the crossing of the
Danube, and does not give a single word to the
Roumanian army. 'The only thing,' he says
about the country, 'is that the Roumanian railways
are indifferent.' That may be so; but
without our indifferent railways, and without the
Roumanian troops, the Russians would not be in
Bulgaria by now."</p>

<p>On July 13 General Gourko succeeded in
crossing the Hainkioi Pass, after encountering
very great difficulties on the narrow mountain
paths. The guns barely managed to keep up
with the columns. On the other hand, serious
news was received from Plevna on July 20, for,
though the Russians succeeded in occupying
Lowtscha, General von Schilder-Schuldner was
forced to beat a speedy retreat halfway to
Nikopoli, screened by his cavalry, leaving the
Turks in possession of Plevna. The Russian
headquarters now requested that the Roumanian
army might occupy Nikopoli and take charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the prisoners of war, but Prince Charles declined
to accede to this without some definite agreement
about the employment of his troops. The
attitude of the Russian diplomats now appeared
to suffer considerable change, so far as the
employment of the Roumanian army was concerned.
Prince Gortchakoff permitted himself
to remark to the Princess, with marked sarcasm:
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toujours pas de blessés Roumains!</i>" to which
she readily replied: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Non, Dieu merci, nous
n'avons que très peu jusqu'à présent!</i>"</p>

<p>The Prince wrote as follows to his consort:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Yesterday, General Sefcari, commissioned by
the Grand Duke Nicholas, arrived here to inform
me that the defeat of the Russians at Plevna was
caused by us: '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dites au Prince que les Roumains
sont cause que nous avons été battus à Plevna!</i>'
The Russian headquarters maintain that a portion
of General Krüdener's troops were retained at
Nikopoli because we had refused to occupy that
fortress and guard and transport the Turkish
prisoners. This is true; I always mean to refuse
such police duties; my army is too good for that.
On the other hand, I have declared my willingness
to occupy Nikopoli and advance with the
Russians against the 35,000 to 45,000 Turks at
Plevna. This offer does not find favour with the
Russians, as they do not wish to share a victory
with us...."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Roumanian troops, however, proceeded at once
to garrison Nikopoli, where the Roumanian flag
was hoisted on July 29, and a message was sent
to the Grand Duke demanding a separate base
of operations in Bulgaria, and the undivided
command of the Roumanian army as the only
condition which Prince Charles could accept.</p>

<p>A report was received at 4 <small>P.M.</small> on the 31st
that the Russians had suffered a severe defeat
at Plevna, and were retiring panic-stricken on
Sistow; this was confirmed at 9 <small>P.M.</small> by the
following despatch in cipher:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>July 19-31, 1877</i>, 3.35 <small>P.M.</small><br />
"<span class="smcap">Prince Charles of Roumania.</span><br />
"Headquarters of the Roumanian Army.
</p>

<p>"The Turks having assembled in great force
at Plevna are crushing us. Beg you to join,
make a demonstration, and, if possible, cross
the Danube, as you wish. This demonstration
between Jiul and Corabia is indispensable to
facilitate my movements.</p>

<p class="sig">
"NICHOLAS."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Prince Charles replied that the Fourth Division
would hold Nikopoli, and that the Third would
occupy the position quitted by the Fourth; the
want of torpedoes would prevent the passage of
the river, as a Turkish monitor was stationed near
Rahova. The headquarters of the Prince were now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
transferred to Corabia, where the bridge was to
be constructed, and a fresh <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ordre de bataille</i> drawn
up in accordance with the altered conditions:</p>

<p>The First Corps, consisting of three infantry
brigades, one cavalry brigade, and six batteries
was to form a general reserve.</p>

<p>The Second Corps suffered no alteration.</p>

<p>The Corps of Observation, under General Lupu,
consisting of two Divisions with six batteries and
two cavalry regiments, remained at Calafat.</p>

<p>The Russian advance, in the meantime, had
come to a complete standstill, whilst some forty
battalions and 200 guns under General Sotow
awaited the arrival of six further Divisions before
attempting to drive Osman Pacha away from his
entrenched position at Plevna. A prolonged
series of despatches now passed between the
Russian and Roumanian Headquarters with reference
to the bridge over the Danube. If the latter
was constructed at Nikopoli, the army would
probably be merged in that of the Grand Duke,
whilst at Magura it would secure independent
action, at the same time cutting off Osman's communications
with Sofia and the East.</p>

<p>The impatience of the Grand Duke at the
repeated delays led to the following despatch
from Colonel Gherghel, attached to his Staff, on
August 16:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"By order of H.I.H. the Grand Duke Nicholas
I have the honour to communicate to your Highness
that H.I.H. desires the Third Roumanian
Division to cross the Danube at once at Nikopoli
to unite with the Fourth. H.I.H. will visit the
two Divisions as soon as they are concentrated."</p></blockquote>

<p>Prince Charles refused to allow the Third Division
to cross, as he had no intention of allowing
his army to be incorporated with the Russian.
This burning question of the command was, however,
satisfactorily settled by the 25th, when the
passage commenced at Corabia opposite Magura.
Prince Charles crossed the Danube on the 20th,
and arrived at the Imperial Headquarters at
Gornija Studena at half-past seven in the evening,
where he was heartily welcomed by the Czar and
the Grand Duke Nicholas. The latter at once
inquired whether he intended to command his
Corps in person, and received a reply in the affirmative.
The Grand Duke then objected that
this decision would give rise to difficulties, as
Prince Charles could not be placed under the
command of a Russian General. The Prince
retorted that that was certainly out of the question,
but ten Russian Generals might easily be
placed under <em>his</em> command.</p>

<p>Whilst Prince Charles was resting from the
fatigues of his journey, the Grand Duke entered
his tent, and on behalf of the Czar offered him
the command of the Russian troops before Plevna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
which the Prince, after some hesitation, accepted.
A council of war was held the following day at
ten o'clock under the shade of a large tree to
discuss the future plans of operation, when it was
decided that, after the passage of the Roumanian
army, the bridge at Corabia should be broken up
and transferred to Nikopoli, where it would be of
further use to the Russian army. Prince Charles
maintained that Osman was stronger than the
Russians supposed, and that for the present it was
useless to resume the offensive.</p>

<p>As Prince Charles returned to Sistow, a terrible
picture of the horrors of war presented itself to
his eyes. Long columns of "ladder" wagons,
laden with wounded soldiers from the desperate
struggles for the Shipka Pass, encountered the
supply columns bringing up food and ammunition.
The most terrible confusion arose, as neither
column could pass the other. The groans and
shrieks of the wounded under a burning sun
increased every minute, and it was only with the
greatest difficulty that the Prince's escort could
force its way through the disorganised mass.</p>

<p>From Corabia Prince Charles bade farewell to
his wife in a letter dated September 1st, 1877,
which frankly recognised the importance of the
task which lay before him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The command before Plevna is no easy
matter: it will cost many a bloody battle before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the Turks are conquered; nay, it may be questioned
whether we shall succeed in this struggle!
But I could not refuse the Emperor's offer,
although I should have preferred my army to
fight in its own sphere of operations. Now my
troops will form the right wing, the Russian
Ninth Corps the centre, and the Fourth the left
wing. The Roumanian troops will cross our
bridge over the Danube to-day. I shall review
them first and then set out for Turnu-Magurele
to proceed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viâ</i> Nikopoli to my headquarters at
Poradim (27 miles from Nikopoli)."</p></blockquote>

<p>Prince Charles found his new headquarters at
Poradim a long straggling Bulgarian village about
four and a half miles from the Turkish line of entrenchments
round Plevna. Only one house at
the entrance to the village seemed fit to live in, but
at the best it was but a poor apology for a house.
Half ruined, without doors or windows, it offered
every opportunity for a study of the discomforts
of campaigning. Here, as elsewhere, the noisome
odour of corruption, caused by the hundreds of
unburied carcases of horses and other animals,
made the air terrible to breathe.</p>

<p>The following morning the Prince found the
troops of the Russian Fourth Corps greatly reduced
in strength, as their effective strength present for
duty only amounted to from 12,000 to 14,000 men
for twenty-one battalions. On inspecting the outposts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
on the heights of Grivitza, Raditschewo,
and Tutschenitza, the Prince realised to the full
the strategical importance of Plevna, and also
the immense difficulties in attacking the Turkish
entrenchments. Osman Pacha's communications
with Suleiman Pacha were seriously affected by
the capture of Lowtcha by Prince Imeritinski and
General Skobeleff on September 6, and it then
became possible to attack Plevna from the south
as well.</p>

<p>A General Order was drafted by the Prince and
his Staff with a view to the attack on the position,
which was so warmly urged by the Grand Duke
and his Staff, but which was to be postponed for
the present.</p>

<p>The troops now under the command of Prince
Charles amounted to 107 battalions, 74 squadrons,
and 442 guns. Total, 75,000 men and 8000
horses.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke Nicholas, whose temperament
had suffered much during the last few weeks,
declared bluntly: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut attaquer absolument</i>,"
to all the representations of the Prince, who was
firmly convinced that Plevna could not be taken
before the arrival of the expected Russian reinforcements.
The Grand Duke, on the other hand,
was afraid that, unless Plevna was taken at once,
Suleiman Pacha would effect a junction with
Osman, and thus outnumber the Russian force.</p>

<p>The preliminary bombardment of Plevna by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
146 guns commenced on September 7, and continued
throughout the night. Little or no
damage was done by this cannonade, to which the
Turkish guns only replied from time to time.
Fire was again opened the following morning
with 226 guns, chiefly concentrated against the
Grivitza redoubt.</p>

<p>About noon Prince Charles noticed that the
guns of his Fourth Division were forced to retire
before the fire of a Turkish redan some 900 yards
to their front. The 13th Dorobanz Regiment,
supported by the 1st Battalion of the 5th Line
Regiment and a section of artillery, were ordered
to take the redan. The attack was successfully
carried out with a loss of two officers and 112
men wounded and 20 killed, about the same time
that General Skobeleff gained possession of the
Green Hill.</p>

<p>A council of war on September 10 decided to
undertake a general attack along the whole line
at 3 <small>P.M.</small> the following day. The only dissentient
vote was that of Prince Charles, who thought that
the four days' bombardment had produced too
little effect, but he gave way to the opinion of
the majority.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock on the momentous morning of
September 11 a hot musketry fire was heard on
the left flank, but owing to the thick mist the
cause could not be ascertained at once, and it was
not until 1 <small>P.M.</small> that Prince Charles received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
report that General Skobeleff had already been
hotly engaged for the last two hours, suffering
severe losses. In the meantime the mist had
lifted, and at 3 <small>P.M.</small> the attacking columns moved
in good order against the entrenchments. After
suffering terrible losses, the columns were obliged
to fall back, leaving innumerable corpses to mark
the line of their advance. Twice the Roumanian
infantry reached the ditch of the death-dealing
Grivitza redoubt; twice, despite the utmost
gallantry, they were forced back. Prince Charles
could no longer watch this desperate struggle
without taking share in it, and galloped down from
his post of observation to the spot where the survivors
of his gallant troops stood. Animated by
the presence and the praises of their leader, the
soldiers demanded to be led once more against the
hitherto impregnable redoubt.</p>

<p>It is nearly half-past five o'clock; the Prince
is going to join the Emperor Alexander, with whom
is the Grand Duke Nicholas, in order to report
to him on the state of affairs. The latter recognised
him from a distance, and met him with the
anxious query, "How are things going?" The
Prince could only reply that the attack had miscarried,
although he had still hope that the first
Grivitza redoubt may be taken. Whilst he is still
conversing with the Emperor, who is very much
affected, an officer of Cossacks rides up at full
gallop with the news that Turkish cavalry has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
broken out of Plevna and is advancing along the
Grivitza road! Everybody present implores the
Emperor to retire immediately from his point of
observation, and to return for safety to his headquarters.
The Emperor cedes to the general wish
and returns to Raditschewo, accompanied by a
large military escort&mdash;a sad spectacle for those
who were present. The thunder of artillery, the
rattling of musketry continue apace although the
day is drawing to a close. The Prince is still
without any news concerning the result of the
attack on the Grivitza redoubt, which he had
ordered to be made. A battalion is drawn from
the reserve for the protection of the Grand Duke
and the Prince. A huge fire is lit, round which
their Highnesses sit down with their staff. Everybody
is more or less overcome by the excitement
of the day, and conversation is at a standstill.
Suddenly at nine o'clock a horseman appears on
the scene. He brings the unexpected, and yet so
anxiously longed-for news, that at half-past seven
o'clock the Roumanians, by a last effort, had taken
the Grivitza redoubt, and captured a Turkish flag
and three cannon. Whilst at the same time four
Russian battalions successfully advanced on the
works from the south; but a second redoubt,
constructed in rear of the first, proved too strong
to be assaulted; thus the Russians were held in
check.</p>

<p>The news of this success, which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
delayed owing to the officer having lost his way
in the dark, acts like magic upon those present.
The Prince immediately sends the joyful tidings
to the Emperor.</p>

<p>General Skobeleff, whose independent advance
was much criticised at headquarters, succeeded in
taking two redoubts on the Green Hill, and
demanded immediate support for his decimated
force. This, however, could not be granted, owing
to the distance (ten miles) from the reserve and
the danger of the troops losing their way across
country by night. The thunder of the guns
and the rattle of musketry continued throughout
the night, and only ceased at daybreak.
The losses sustained proved to be enormous&mdash;16,000
killed and wounded, amongst them 2600
Roumanians.</p>

<p>A council of war, held the second day after the
battle, in the absence of Prince Charles, decided
to summon General von Todleben, the ever famous
defender of Sebastopol, with the whole of the
Imperial Guard; to desist from further assaults
until their arrival, and to entrench the positions
gained. A few votes (amongst others that of the
Grand Duke) were even given for the withdrawal
of the whole army behind the line of the Osma.
The total want of initiative shown by General
Krylow, who commanded the centre, led to his
removal from the command of the Fourth Russian
Corps, which was then given to General Pomeranzew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Prince Charles assembled his generals
in the great battery near Raditschewo, and
gave them orders to shorten the line enclosing
Plevna; the counter-entrenchments which were
ordered suffered considerable delay, however,
as the Russian troops carried no entrenching
tools.</p>

<p>The second Grivitza redoubt was attacked by
the Roumanians on the 18th, but Prince Charles,
who personally superintended the attack, was
compelled to recall his brave troops, as the
Turkish fire inflicted annihilating losses on the
assaulting columns, who, nevertheless, succeeded
in reaching the ditch of the redoubt. The losses
amounted to 20 officers and 583 men killed and
wounded within two hours.</p>

<p>General von Todleben arrived before Plevna on
September 30, and at a council of war at once
expressed the opinion that the Turkish army
could only be forced to surrender by means of a
blockade. Plevna must be completely surrounded
before a blockade could be enforced, and at least
two more Corps were needed for this purpose.
A Cavalry Corps under General Gourko was
formed to operate on the far bank of the Wid,
and to prevent Turkish supply columns from
entering Plevna on that side.</p>

<p>The Prince thus described the state of affairs in
a letter to Princess Elisabeth, dated October 5th,
1877:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Imperial Headquarters Staff have at last
realised the situation, and a large army is now
to be concentrated here: several divisions of infantry,
in addition to the Imperial Guard!</p>

<p>"All these troops will be placed under my
command, a distinction which cannot be over-estimated
from a military and political point of
view. General Todleben is appointed as my
second-in-command, with Prince Imeritinski as
Chief of my Staff: they are both pleased at being
under my command, the latter, indeed, had before
applied for the post, whilst the former told me
that he was happy to serve under a German
Prince, and especially under a Hohenzollern. I
replied that I felt complimented at having the
celebrated defender of Sebastopol at my side, and
that I regarded him as my military preceptor from
whom I had much to learn. We are already
excellent friends, and understand each other perfectly.
I told him candidly what I thought about
the attack of September 11th and the course to be
pursued now, and had the satisfaction of hearing
from him that my proposals were absolutely
correct then, and are so still."</p></blockquote>

<p>A curious incident is related in his next
letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Yesterday evening at nine o'clock (October 8),
as I was at work with General Todleben and
Prince Imeritinski, the aide-de-camp on duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
rushed into the room to report that an alarm had
been given along the whole line: large watch-fires
were seen and guns were heard in the distance!
The two squadrons of my escort saddled at once,
and aides-de-camp and orderlies galloped up from
all sides. I did not allow myself to be disquieted,
and declared at once that it was a false alarm, for
the night was so dark, the weather so terrible,
and the roads so impassable from the downpour
of rain, that it was impossible for the enemy to
adopt the offensive. Several officers, who had
been sent out, soon returned with the news that
the Rifle Brigade of the Guard had lost their
way, and had called for guides. Count Woronzow,
the Chief of Staff of the Guard, at once rode to
meet the troops; but small detachments of the
Brigade wandered about the whole night, and did
not assemble until this morning, stiff with cold and
wet. The fires, which had appeared so large in
the mist, were only those of our own bivouacs....
I am now rather more comfortably furnished;
since the last few days I have managed to obtain
windows and doors, straw mats on the floor, and
had the roof repaired, so that the rain no longer
falls into my bedroom....</p>

<p>"The weather has been terrible for the last
eight days, and the troops have suffered much in
consequence: their boots simply rot on their feet
in the melting snow: many have lost limbs
through frost-bite, and the hospital tents are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
sufficient to receive all the sick&mdash;more than 2000
men in the Army of the West!</p>

<p>"... I visited the Roumanian troops in the
trenches, where they are standing knee-deep in
mud and water! The breastworks have fallen in
in many places, so that they are exposed to the
musketry of the Turks, and many men have been
wounded during the last few days."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sufferings of the troops were still further
increased by the destruction of the bridges over
the Danube, and to the discomforts of cold and
wet was added the terror of starvation. A number
of disputes occurred between the Russian and
Roumanian foraging-parties, which culminated one
day in a party of Russians being marched past the
Prince's quarters as prisoners!</p>

<p>The second Grivitza redoubt was taken, after a
first unsuccessful attempt, by the Roumanians on
October 19, but the Turkish reserves eventually
forced them to retire, with a loss of 300 killed and
707 wounded. The Russians, however, succeeded
in gaining possession of the great redoubt at
Gornji-Dubnik under cover of night on the 24th,
and thereby completed the investment of Plevna,
from which Osman could now only escape by
forcing his way through the lines of the Allies.</p>

<p>The course of the investment proved uneventful
until November 10, when General Skobeleff took
the Green Hill by a night attack, with the comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
trifling loss of 200 men. This important
point commands the town of Plevna, and its
capture could not fail to hasten the end of the
siege. Every attempt, especially by means of
night attacks, was made by the Turks to drive the
Russians out of this position, but each attempt
was defeated by the stern valour of Skobeleff's
veterans. In reply to the Grand Duke's summons
to surrender, Osman Pacha sent the proud and
soldierly answer that he had not yet exhausted
all his means, and therefore could not capitulate:
that his honour as a soldier required him to hold
out to the last.</p>

<p>The whole Russo-Roumanian line investing
Plevna was now divided into six sections under
separate commanders. The first and largest, consisting
of some thirty field works connected by
shelter-trenches, extended for nine and a half
miles from the right bank of the Wid to the Griwitza
redoubt, the second ran from thence to the
Plevna-Rustchuk road, the third to the Tutschenitza
Ravine, and the fourth to Krtuschab, the
fifth to the line of the Wid, and the sixth completed
the circle to the west of that river.</p>

<p>The difficulties of his position were thus
described by Prince Charles, November 17,
1877:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The command here is no easy task, for the
General Staff often alter the dispositions, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Imperial headquarters interfere directly on every
occasion, thereby causing confusion. This has,
however, been amended after some representations,
and we are now left alone. The expression,
'under my immediate command,' in my last
General Order, marks the altered conditions, and
prevents any direct interference. It sometimes
looks to me as though the Russians found me in
the way!...</p>

<p>"A few days ago I visited the Roumanian right
wing opposite Oponetz, and ordered a heavy bombardment
to be commenced against the redoubts.
The Turks did not reply, which proves that their
ammunition is running short; our outposts then
advanced and occupied the nearest heights without
resistance. We only lost two men. Plevna
can only hold out for another fortnight at the
most; we expect Osman to attempt to break
through any day, which will be the sign that his
supply of food has come to an end. The position
held by Skobeleff is continually attacked by the
Turks, especially at night; they hope to find
there a means of escape. Skobeleff has been
slightly wounded twice; it is a miracle that he
has not met his death, for he is always in the
thick of the bullets...."</p></blockquote>

<p>A Roumanian detachment, under Colonel
Slaniceanu, after a hot engagement took the
Turkish works at Rahova, with a loss of over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
300 men, on November 20, and two Turkish
guns and 140 ammunition carts fell into the
hands of the victor. This success was followed
up by the occupation of Tzibar Palanka and
Rasgrad-Mahala, whence an attempt was to be
made on Lom-Palanka.</p>

<p>Another period of stormy weather followed
December 5 and increased the already enormous
difficulties of supply by carrying away nineteen
pontoons of the bridge at Nikopoli. The roads
became quite impassable; hundreds of horses
succumbed to privation and overwork, and lay
rotting by the roadside.</p>

<p>The long expected attempt of Osman Pacha to
break through the lines of investment took place
on December 10. A report was received the
night before that the Turks were bridging the
Wid, followed at half-past eight the next morning
by the news that the besieged were commencing
a sally. On hearing that the Roumanians had
occupied the second Grivitza redoubt, Prince
Charles at once repaired to that vantage-point,
and eventually to the heights commanding
Bukowa. At half-past eleven Prince Charles
reported to the Czar by telegraph: "The battle
on the other side of the Wid has come to a
standstill. I can clearly distinguish the three
lines, the Turks being caught between two fires.
The first prisoners are now on their way to me."</p>

<p>The reports which subsequently reached Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Charles showed that the course of the action was
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Turks commenced a hot fire from the guns
posted near the Wid at half-past seven, just as
the thick morning mist lifted; several columns
then crossed the river by the stone bridge and
that constructed near Opanetz, and attacked the
redoubt near Gornji-Netropol with such vigour that
the 9th Russian Grenadiers were forced to retire,
leaving eight guns in the redoubt. The next
redoubt was also taken at the first rush, as the
reserves had no time to reinforce the first line.
The two Russian Grenadier Divisions, however,
prevented any further progress of the attacking
columns, though they were unable to regain
possession of the lost redoubts. At ten o'clock
the advance of the Roumanians against the
enemy's right flank caused the Turks to form
front to that direction as well. The struggle
continued till noon, by which time the Turkish
troops were completely surrounded, and their
commander, wounded in the left leg by a splinter
of a shell, then decided to surrender, as his force
could neither advance on Sofia nor retire to Plevna.</p>

<p>A white flag was hoisted on a cottage not far
from the bridge over the Wid about 1 <small>P.M.</small>, and
a staff officer was despatched to find the commander
of the nearest body of troops. A
Roumanian officer, Colonel Cerchez, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
fortunate man to receive the message that
Osman Pacha wished to see him. The Turkish
Commander-in-Chief was having his wound
dressed when Colonel Cerchez reached the cottage.
He declined, however, to receive Osman's sword,
as he had no authority to do so, and sent for
General Ganetzki. On the arrival of the Russian
General, Osman was forced to surrender unconditionally,
as his situation was absolutely hopeless.
No less than 40,000 men and seventy-seven
guns thus fell into the hands of the victors.</p></blockquote>

<p>An indescribable scene of confusion presented
itself to the eyes of Prince Charles, who, on
hearing of the surrender of the Turkish commander,
proceeded to the bridge over the Wid,
where the decisive struggle had taken place.
Russian and Roumanian Corps alternated with
long columns of prisoners and fugitives from
Plevna; thousands of carts, waggons, and horses,
laden with the wretched goods and chattels of
the Mohammedan population, blocks the Sofia
road. A carriage, surrounded by Roumanian
troopers, was suddenly encountered, and proved
to contain no less a person than Osman Pacha,
accompanied by Tahir Pacha, the Chief of Staff,
and Tewfik Pacha, the Chief Engineer. "The
Turkish Commander is a man of middle height
and thick-set figure; his large melancholy eyes
lend his face a most attractive expression, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
whole manner is quiet, dignified, and sympathetic."
Prince Charles shook hands with him, and
expressed his admiration at the heroic defence of
Plevna. The Grand Duke Nicholas, who arrived
at this moment, also expressed his admiration of
this feat of arms, and ordered the distinguished
prisoner to be treated with the utmost attention.
Prince Charles subsequently returned through
Plevna to Poradim to report the course of events
to the Czar. The following day the Czar, after
attending a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> in the open air in celebration
of the victory, sent for Osman Pacha, who
had not yet quitted the vicinity of Plevna. The
Turkish General was received by his Imperial
Majesty in the presence of the Grand Duke
Nicholas and Prince Charles. After paying
tribute to the heroic courage with which Plevna
had been defended, the Czar returned Osman's
sword as a mark of esteem, a compliment which
the latter briefly acknowledged with true Oriental
courtesy.</p>

<p>It was decided by a council of war to reinforce
General Gourko, so that the projected advance
on Sofia might proceed at once, and Prince
Charles's offer to observe Widin with two
Divisions, whilst a third escorted the prisoners
of war to the Russian frontier, was gratefully
accepted, since demands for reinforcements
were received daily from all parts of the theatre
of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Charles took leave of the army investing
Plevna with the following order:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">

"<span class="smcap">Officers and Soldiers!</span>
</p>

<p>"Your endurance and your heroic struggle
have been crowned with success. Plevna, which the
enemy believed to be impregnable and capable of
preventing the victorious advance of his Majesty
the Czar; Plevna, which has cost the Christian
forces so much noble blood; Plevna has fallen!</p>

<p>"The aim of the investing army, the command
of which his Imperial Majesty was pleased to
entrust to me, has now been fulfilled, and this
order conveys to the Imperial Russian troops,
which I had the honour to command, my farewell
greeting, and at the same time my gratitude for
the self-sacrificing devotion which has been
accorded to me by the whole army from general
to private.</p>

<p>"You have fought under the eyes of your august
Czar and your chivalrous Commander-in-Chief,
H.I.H. the Grand Duke Nicholas. They have
both been witnesses of your heroic courage, and
there is no need for me to add my praise to
theirs.</p>

<p>"You have set a shining example of valour and
the highest military virtues to my young Roumanian
army. The glorious Imperial army has
become united with my troops by an irrefragable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
bond of friendship, and I hope that you will preserve
the same friendly remembrance of your
Roumanian brothers-in-arms as they will of you.</p>

<p>"I lay down my command with regret, and it is
my most fervent wish on taking leave of you that
in your future struggles for our holy cause you
may achieve as glorious successes as in the past.</p>

<p>"Therefore let us join once more before we part
in that joyous exclamation which springs from your
hearts: Long life to his Majesty the Czar!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The Emperor Alexander sent the following
official letter to Prince Charles, dated 1/13 December,
1877:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After a resistance of five months, the combined
efforts of our allied troops have been crowned with
complete success. The army of Osman Pacha has
laid down its arms and Plevna has fallen. Desirous
of consecrating the memory of this great success,
and the personal part your Highness has had in
it, I take pleasure in conferring on your Highness
on this occasion my Order of St. Andreas with
swords. I beg your Highness to accept the
insignia as a mark of my sincere affection, the
expression of which I renew.</p>

<p class="sig">
"ALEXANDER."
</p></blockquote>

<p>On December 5, the Grand Duke Nicholas
issued an Order of the Day in which occurs the
following passage:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... In prescribing the dissolution of the
corps in question I consider I ought to express my
sincere gratitude to its chief, his Highness Prince
Charles of Roumania, who, since August 17,
has commanded the allied troops forming in the
first instance the Army of the West, and later on
the Corps of Investment. Thanks to his exceptional
activity his Highness was able to establish
the most complete cohesion between the Russian
and Roumanian troops, to form them into one
homogeneous body, and to direct their efforts in
conformity with my prescriptions towards the final
aim which has so brilliantly crowned the common
task (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'œuvre commune</i>)...."</p></blockquote>

<p>His Imperial Highness forwarded this document
to Prince Charles, together with a letter which
contained a warm tribute to Prince Charles and
the Roumanian army:</p>

<p>"The brilliant results which have just been
obtained before Plevna are in a great measure due
to the co-operation of the brave Roumanian army,
as well as to the impulse which the allied troops
received from their immediate commander, whose
activity, courage, and devotion to his soldierly
duties they admired and strove to imitate."</p>

<p>Amongst the many compliments which were
showered on the Commander of the Army of
Investment, none was more deeply appreciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
than the following despatch from the German
Emperor:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">

"<span class="smcap">Prince Charles of Roumania, Poradim</span>,
</p>

<p>"I have followed your operations and noted
the valour of your troops with the greatest interest.
I cannot express too warmly my pleasure at this
success; and I permit myself to confer on you
herewith my military Order&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pour le Mérite</i>. As
you are aware of the value placed on this Order by
my army, you will no doubt appreciate its bestowal.
How many dangers, exertions, and privations you
must have shared with your troops before you
could at last celebrate a glorious triumph by the
fall of Plevna! God be with you in the future.</p>

<p class="sig">
"WILLIAM."
</p></blockquote>

<p>After an absence of four eventful months Prince
Charles set out on December 22, a bitterly cold
day, for Nikopoli <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for Bucharest. The
roadsides offered a terrible picture of the horrors
of war. Almost every step was marked by the
corpse of some Turkish prisoner or Russian invalid
who had succumbed to the bitter cold. One
incident became engraved indelibly upon the
Prince's mind. A little group of Turks appeared
to be talking round the fragment of a wheel at
some slight distance from the road, but on closer
inspection they were found to be all frozen to
death over their last fire. Even the streets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Nikopoli were not free from these ghastly milestones,
and the Prince's thoughts involuntarily
turned to the story of Napoleon's retreat from
Russia. The unfortunate Turkish prisoners, to
the number of 11,000, were herded together in the
ditch of the fort exposed to the bitter cold
(22° R.) without even a vestige of warm clothing.
Small wonder that the Prince, who could do
nothing to alleviate their sufferings, hastened to
cross the Danube, beyond the reach of their groans
and supplications.</p>

<p>As only a few of the pontoons had managed to
resist the pressure of the ice, Prince Charles was
forced to cross the Danube by means of a small
steamboat, which took an hour to reach the
Roumanian bank. His first action on reaching
Turnu-Magurele was directed to alleviating the
miseries of the wounded and the unfortunate
prisoners, to which merciful work he devoted
Christmas Day of 1877.</p>

<p>A welcome letter from his father was received
here:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Roumania must now maintain its vitality by
the development of its independence, and prove
practically to the Powers that it has become an
essential member of the European States.</p>

<p>"I have followed the successes of your brave
troops with undiminished attention. Their
organisation has justified itself, the spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
officers is the result of your training. Their
achievements have everywhere been such as one
could hardly expect from veteran troops. This
attainment of an object persistently pursued must
be the highest reward for your self-sacrificing
efforts, and is at the same time a triumph over
the public opinion of Europe, which has never had
much sympathy with the Roumanian State and
its army.</p>

<p>"At the present it is impossible to foresee what
will happen after the fall of Plevna. I do
not believe in the prophecies of the Press regarding
an expected peace, for Russia cannot
possibly content herself with the result of Plevna.
She must set right the mistaken beginning of the
whole campaign against Turkey, which rested
upon false calculations and disparagement of the
enemy. These events, however, have been fortunate
for Roumania, for the insufficiency of the
Russian means of war was the very reason why
the support of the Roumanian army became a
necessity. It seems almost the work of Providence
that such tasks and efforts in the theatre of
war should have fallen to the lot of the Roumanians
as to place them on a footing of equality
in the eyes of Russia and Europe....</p>

<p>"As soon as the military difficulties have been
conquered, political troubles will accumulate to a
still greater degree. The Triple Alliance must
now prove its strength, for, if it is firmly united,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the decision of European affairs will lie in its
hands alone...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Princess Elisabeth awaited her husband, from
whom she had been separated for four long and
anxious months, at Titu, from whence they
reached Bucharest at one o'clock. The whole
population of the capital turned out to do honour
to their ruler, who had shared their dangers and
their troubles, and who had achieved the independence
of his adopted country sword in hand.</p>

<p>The day closed with a magnificent torchlight
procession under the windows of the palace, after
which Prince Charles and his wife drove through
the brilliantly illuminated streets.</p>

<p>Whilst Prince Charles had been manfully
engaged in the field, the Princess had made it
her special care to look after "her" wounded, as
she termed them, and it was therefore with a
special pleasure that the Prince learnt that the
merciful efforts of his wife had been recognised
and appreciated by the Czarina, who sent a
special messenger to Princess Elisabeth with the
Order of St. Catherine in brilliants, on the
occasion of her birthday (December 29).</p>

<p>A telegram from the Turkish Minister of War,
Reuf Pacha, addressed to the Grand Duke
Nicholas at <em>Bucharest</em>, informed the Russian
Commander that the Porte had empowered Mehemed
Ali to negotiate an armistice. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Prince Charles thought that the Russians would
hardly desist from their victorious advance, he
nevertheless telegraphed to the Grand Duke,
requesting that Roumania should participate in
the negotiations with which her interests were so
closely connected. Colonel Arion was sent to the
Russian headquarters to act on behalf of the
Prince in the approaching negotiations for an
armistice. His instructions were, briefly, to
obtain&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The occupation of the Danubian fortresses
by Roumanian troops until the conclusion of
peace.</p>

<p>(2) The recognition of Roumania's independence.</p>

<p>(3) The dismantling of the Turkish fortresses on
the Danube from Adakaleh in the west to the
mouth of the river.</p>

<p>(4) The transfer to Roumania of all the mouths
of the Danube.</p>

<p>(5) A war indemnity of 100,000,000 francs and
the occupation of Nikopoli, Rahova, Lom-Palanka,
and Widin until payment in full.</p>

<p>In the event of the Roumanian plenipotentiary
not taking part in the negotiations, Colonel Arion
was instructed to protest against every clause
affecting Roumania which was agreed to in his
absence, and to declare the same null and void.
A large indemnity was demanded, because it was
intended to cover the heavy expenses and losses
incurred through the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The difficulties which Roumania seemed likely
to encounter at the conclusion of peace are thus
alluded to by Prince Charles in a letter to the
German Crown Prince, January 14, 1878:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The newspapers are full of rumours that the
Russians intend to resume possession of the Bessarabian
districts, incorporated in Roumania by
the Treaty of Paris. I cannot believe this, seeing
that we have rendered them great service at a
most critical moment. Moreover, such a rectification
of the frontier would most decidedly be
against the interests of Germany and Austria,
who must prevent the mouths of the Danube from
falling into the hands of a great Power.</p>

<p>"The Second Article of the treaty regulating
the passage of the Russian army through Roumania
lays it down that the Government of his Majesty
the Czar pledges itself to maintain and defend the
former integrity of Roumania. Though it cannot
be believed that this formal engagement is to be
violated, still great anxiety prevails here, especially
as the Russian Press constantly refers to
this topic."</p></blockquote>

<p>Minister Cogalniceanu also forwarded a Note to
the Russian Agent in Bucharest, laying stress on
the fact that Roumania had proclaimed its independence
by declaring war with the Porte direct,
and that the army had crossed the Danube at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
invitation of the Russian Government as well as
of the Headquarters Staff. The independent
character which Roumania assumed during the
war could not, therefore, be cast aside when, at
the conclusion of hostilities, the work of diplomacy
commenced. The Roumanian Government accordingly
claimed the right and the duty of taking
part in the negotiations, just as the army had
shared the heat and the burden of the fighting.
On January 29, however, Prince Ghika reported
by telegraph from St. Petersburg that the Czar
and his Chancellor had formally notified him of
the intention of the Russian Government to
regain possession of the Roumanian portion of
Bessarabia, whilst Roumania was to be indemnified
by the Delta of the Danube and the Dobrutscha as
far as Kustendje. The motive assigned was that
the territory in question was not ceded to Roumania
but to Moldavia, and had been separated
from Russia by a treaty of which scarcely a single
provision remained in force. Moreover, the
national dignity and honour of Russia demanded
the re-acquisition of this district. General Ignatieff,
it was said, would be sent to Bucharest to
negotiate direct with Prince Charles and his
Government. In reply to all Ghika's remonstrances,
Gortchakoff retorted: "Whatever
arguments you employ, they cannot modify our
decision, which is unalterable. You are opposed
by a political necessity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>General Ignatieff arrived at Bucharest on
January 31, 1878, and presented the following
almost threatening letter from Prince Gortchakoff
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"His Majesty the Czar considers that the time
has arrived to elucidate certain questions which I
have already discussed in general terms with your
Excellency regarding the future peace. It is
essential that there should be no misunderstanding
on this point.</p>

<p>"It is with a view to avoiding such misunderstandings
that my august master is sending his
aide-de-camp, General Count Ignatieff, to Bucharest.
He will explain to you the views of the
Imperial Cabinet, with the general tendency of
which your Excellency is already acquainted. You
know that we desire to do everything for Roumania
that is possible in the field of diplomacy.
But your Excellency knows also that we have
interests and rights to guard which we cannot
forego. What we expect from the Roumanian
Government is a just and rational appreciation of
its situation and ours. This is the way in which
the traditions which unite Roumania to Russia
may be perpetuated and consolidated. Your
country owes its past to us, and I believe that it
will also find in us its most solid support in the
future. I reckon on the keen intelligence of your
Excellency and of the President of the Council to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
see to it that high and statesmanlike views
shall prevail over party passions at a moment
which may be decisive for the relations between
our countries."</p></blockquote>

<p>Count Ignatieff did not mention the proposed
cession of Bessarabia to Prince Charles until the
latter questioned him on this point. The Prince
then declared his inability to accede to this
exchange, which he felt convinced did not
emanate from the Czar, but from his Majesty's
political <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entourage</i>. The Russian envoy subsequently
touched upon the possibility of Prince
Charles being elected to the throne of Bulgaria,
and even asked what would be his attitude should
such an offer be made. The Prince, needless to
say, answered evasively, and at once turned the
conversation.</p>

<p>The Roumanian Agent in Paris reported on the
25th that neither M. Waddington, Lord Lyons,
nor Prince Hohenlohe were informed of the Russian
demands on Bessarabia, and that he had come to the
conviction that the question of the proposed cession
excited very little interest amongst the Powers,
whilst not even Germany was expected to protest
against the action of Russia.</p>

<p>The papers relating to the recent diplomatic
correspondence were laid before a secret sitting
of the Chamber and the Senate on February 4.
Amidst the greatest excitement, the representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of the nation declared that Roumania would
preserve the integrity of its territory to the last,
with armed force if necessary. A resolution embodying
the claims of Roumania to the consideration
of Russia, and referring to the guarantee
of the Powers, as well as to the promise contained
in the Convention of March 4, 1877, was adopted
unanimously by the Chamber and by a large
majority in the Senate.</p>

<p>A critical period now arrived with the news that
the English Lower House had voted £6,000,000
sterling for military preparations, whilst the
advance of the British fleet to the entrance of
the Dardanelles led to the Russian occupation of
several entrenchments within the neutral zone
before Constantinople. Owing to the threatening
attitude of England, delays took place in the
treaty of peace, and Russia threatened to occupy
Constantinople. The English Ambassador at
Vienna remarked to the Roumanian Agent that
his Government had no information about the
Russian claims to Bessarabia, and pointed out that
this question was of a very delicate nature, because
Russia appeared to lay special stress on the retrocession
of the districts, and also because of the
unwillingness of other States to interfere between
allies.</p>

<p>Cogalniceanu laid two important Notes before
the Prince on February 14, 1878, referring to the
independence of Roumania, and addressed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Powers and the Sublime Porte. The first Note
referred to a former one of June 3, proclaiming
independence, and at the same time requesting
the Powers to abstain from recognising it until
the decisive moment arrived. This had now
occurred, and Roumania hoped that the Powers
would now welcome her as worthy of admission to
the great European family, seeing that she had
sealed her independence with the sword. The
Note concluded with the request that a Roumanian
delegate might attend the approaching conference.
The second Note, addressed to Constantinople,
expressed a desire to resume friendly relations
with the Porte, and referred briefly to the reasons
which led Roumania to take part in the war. The
voluntary recognition of the accomplished independence
would create a firmer and more valuable
bond of union between Turkey and Roumania
than that which now belonged to the past.</p>

<p>The preliminaries of the peace were signed at
Adrianople on January 31, 1878, when the following
conditions were agreed to:</p>

<p>(1) Bulgaria to be formed into an autonomous tributary
principality under a Christian Government.</p>

<p>(2) The independence of Montenegro to be
recognised.</p>

<p>(3) Roumania and Servia to be independent and
to receive an increase of territory.</p>

<p>(4) Bosnia and Herzegovina to be granted an
autonomous administration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>(5) Russia to be indemnified for the expense and
losses caused by the war.</p>

<p>Prince Bismarck, speaking of the Eastern
Question in the Reichstag, said the preliminaries
of peace in no way affected the interests of
Germany, and that there was no cause to exchange
the part of a spectator for that of an actor. The
question of the Dardanelles alone was of great
importance, for "the water ways, the straits, as
well as the Danube from the Black Sea northwards,
must remain open to German commerce."
Germany, declared the Chancellor, would not
adopt the attitude of an arbitrator, but that of an
"honest broker," who had every intention of doing
business (<i>i.e.</i>, in effecting a lasting peace). The
German Empire would never sacrifice the friendship
with Russia, which had been proved through
past generations, in order to obtain the vain credit
of playing the judge in Europe!</p>

<p>The attitude to be adopted by Prince Charles
was thus sketched out by his father:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The offered portion of the unproductive Dobrutscha
is, indeed, no compensation for the cession
of Bessarabia, but will, nevertheless, be acceptable
if Küstendje forms part of the bargain.
Indeed, the acquisition of this Black Sea port may
perhaps be of the greatest importance to the
future of the flourishing commerce of Roumania.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conditio sine quâ non</i> for the incorporation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the district on the right bank must be the dismantling
of the Danubian fortresses, for an autonomous
Bulgaria has no need for fortified protection
on its northern frontier, whilst they might, even
under changed circumstances, prove a danger to
Roumania, as they would become so many sally-ports
in time of war."</p></blockquote>

<p>The virgin fortress of Widin, which had been
invested by three Roumanian Divisions, was
handed over by Isset Pacha on February 24,
when the Turkish garrison marched out with all
the honours of war. An enormous quantity of
munitions of war was found in the magazines, but
the supplies of food appeared to be almost
exhausted. A day later the rock fortress of
Belgradjik was also handed over to the Roumanians
with the same ceremonies.</p>

<p>The following laconic telegram from the Grand
Duke Nicholas was handed to Prince Charles on
March 3, 1878:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is with great pleasure that I inform you
that the peace has just been signed."</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE BERLIN CONGRESS AND AFTER</h3>


<p class="noind">The feelings of consternation and bitter resentment
evoked by the publication of the Treaty of
San Stefano soon found expression in the Roumanian
Chamber, where the action of the Russian
Government was criticised in scathing terms, and
in the Press, whose comments on the situation
were little calculated to restrain the popular
indignation. The Minister of the Exterior telegraphed
to the various Roumanian diplomatic
agents abroad that the Government felt itself
compelled to protest against a treaty, every
article of which was either directly or indirectly
opposed to the interests of Roumania. Prince
Charles, on the other hand, was convinced of the
futility of all protests, and the impossibility of
retaining Bessarabia, and was therefore chiefly
concerned in checking the growing hostility of
the Roumanian nation towards their all-powerful
neighbour. At the same time no effort was
spared to secure the representation of Roumania<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
at the impending European Congress, and M.
Bratianu, the President of the Ministry, was
despatched for this purpose to Vienna and Berlin
with letters from the Prince himself.</p>

<p>Though the general disposition towards Roumania
on the part of the Great Powers was that
of lukewarm platonic sympathy, a ray of hope
was at one time afforded by the warlike attitude
of England, who would only agree to a Congress
empowered to consider the whole of the Treaty of
San Stefano. General Ignatieff traversed Europe
in order to effect an understanding between the
several Cabinets. Prince Charles Anthony, however,
warned his son that "the loss of the
Bessarabian region must now be regarded as inevitable,
and the only consolation is that the
sympathy of public opinion generally is accorded
to you and to your country."</p>

<p>During the absence of Bratianu, Prince Gortchakoff
transmitted to the Roumanian Agent in
St. Petersburg a threat which had fallen from the
mouth of the Czar himself: that if Roumania
protested against Article VIII. of the Treaty
(which defined the route of the Russian troops
through Roumania), he, the Czar, would disarm
the Roumanian army. Prince Charles at once
caused the following reply to be forwarded: "The
Roumanian army, which fought so gallantly
before Plevna under the eyes of the Czar, may
be annihilated, but will never be disarmed!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>The situation was critical, since the Russian
army practically occupied the Principality, and
the flimsiest pretexts were employed to increase
the number of troops in and round Bucharest.
The threats of Prince Gortchakoff were discussed
throughout Europe, even in the English
Parliament. At length Prince Charles was forced
to prepare for the worst, and to make arrangements
to remove his troops and Government to
Little Wallachia. The tension between Russia
and Roumania was still further increased at
this period by a remarkable incident. On the
conclusion of the peace, Prince Charles had forwarded
a congratulatory letter to the Czar
through the Consul-General at Bucharest, and
was therefore greatly surprised to learn from
Prince Alexander of Battenberg that the Czar
was complaining at not having received his congratulations.
It was then discovered that the
Imperial aide-de-camp, to whom the letter had
been entrusted, had been seriously ill at Vienna,
and the unfortunate delay of six weeks was
thus accounted for. The Czar telegraphed as
follows immediately the letter reached his hands
(April 8, 1878):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your kind letter of the 21st February did not
reach me until to-day. I thank you sincerely for
it, and offer the same prayers as yourself that the
peace may become firm and lasting. My feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and my friendship for you and Princess Elisabeth
will remain unaltered; but I cannot but regret
the attitude of those who are at the head of your
Government, and who have brought about a
situation which is entirely antagonistic to the
real interests of Roumania."</p></blockquote>

<p>A letter expressed the Czar's views still more
forcibly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... The painful relations created by the
measures of your Ministers cannot alter my
affectionate interest and friendship for you. I
regret having been obliged to indicate the
measures which their course of action may eventually
force me to adopt. You cannot doubt how
pleased I should be to be able to avoid this, for
it is not in such a light that I should care to
see our traditionally amicable relations placed,
cemented as they are by our brotherhood in arms;
and I am certain that you yourself share my
sentiments. I understand the desire of your
Government to regulate by a special arrangement
the relations which an extension of the stay of
my army on the Danube will necessitate. But
the peace is not yet finally concluded, and our
conventions have therefore not ceased to hold
good. You certainly understand, moreover, that
it is impossible for me to allow the least uncertainty
to hover over the communications and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
supplies of my troops. A friendly arrangement
between our two Governments might easily
regulate matters in view of the new situation,
which would follow a definite peace. I am quite
willing to lend myself to this measure, and I
have therefore ordered a special official to proceed
to Bucharest, who will be instructed to discuss
the same with your Ministers. I shall be delighted
to see an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</i> established, and I
believe that this will be more in the interests of
Roumania than the existing tension of our
relations. I hope that you will bring your
support to bear upon the issue, and you may
rest assured of mine....</p>

<p class="sig">
"ALEXANDER."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Prince Charles thus describes the situation in a
letter to his father:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The East is confronted by a new crisis from
which, thanks to its energetic attitude, my
country will not emerge the loser. The Treaty
of San Stefano is the work of Ignatieff.... I
rejoice at the resolute attitude of England.... I
asked several Russian Generals, who paid their
respects to me to-day, what was the meaning of
the movements of the troops in the country, and
they told me that several Divisions were preparing
to return to Russia: the army was longing for
peace, and was thoroughly tired of the war."...</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the disquiet caused by the movements
of the Russian troops did not disappear,
although they were declared to be only directed
against Austria.</p>

<p>As Prince Charles had foreseen, Roumania had
little active support to expect from the Great
Powers. Prince Bismarck informed M. Bratianu,
who had been received with assurances of friendship
both at Vienna and Berlin, that Bessarabia
was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ non</i> for Russia, and he therefore
advised Roumania to come to an understanding
with that Power before the assembly of the
Congress, by voluntarily surrendering the three
Pruth districts. Roumania might then obtain
much, very much indeed, as compensation from
the great Empire. Prince Charles considered
this course practicable, but Bratianu was in
favour of holding out until the last moment.
Lord Salisbury, on the other hand, assured the
Roumanian Agent in Paris that Prince Charles
might count upon England's effectual support in
peace and in war, though this promise lost much
of its value by the addition that more important
questions than the fate of Bessarabia existed for
England, and, provided these were settled amicably,
war would not be declared for the sake of
Roumania.</p>

<p>The British armaments, which included the
movement of Indian troops to the Mediterranean
garrisons, continued to increase until May, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Count Schuwaloff's mission at last secured the
assembly of the Congress. In the meantime,
Prince Charles inspected his forces in Little
Wallachia. The Russians and Roumanians at no
great distance from the capital were dangerously
near to one another, and the Roumanian Chamber
voted increased supplies for war material on its
own initiative. The whole of Roumania was
anxious to make every possible sacrifice in defence
of the national honour.</p>

<p>Two dastardly attempts on the life of the
venerable German Emperor evoked feelings of
the deepest indignation throughout the world.
Prince Charles telegraphed as follows on behalf
of both himself and his consort:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We cannot find words in which to express
our consternation and grief at the execrable deed
which has again endangered your Majesty's life.
We thank God that the wound is not serious, and
hope that the certain knowledge that you are
surrounded by the deep love of many millions will
help your Majesty out of the bitterness of these
hours."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Congress was at length opened by Prince
Bismarck at Berlin on June 13, 1878, after Count
Schuwaloff had succeeded in making terms with
England, whereby Russia was allowed to annex
Bessarabia and Batoum in return for the division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
of Bulgaria. In appointing Bratianu and Cogalniceanu
as Roumanian delegates, Prince Charles
again reminded them that, since Bessarabia must
be considered as lost to Roumania, they must
endeavour to obtain the greatest possible territorial
compensation on the right bank of the
Danube, possibly even as far as the line Rustchuk-Varna.
The Roumanian delegates were,
however, not permitted to attend the sittings of
the Congress until after the representatives of
the Powers had decided to sanction the annexation
of Bessarabia by Russia. Yet another severe
blow was destined to fall on Roumania, and by
the hand, too, of a formerly friendly power,
France. Before the independence of Roumania
was recognised, all restrictions upon the political
and civil rights of all creeds, imposed by the
Constitution, were to be removed; in other words,
the Roumanian Jews were to be admitted to the
franchise. All the entreaties and representations
of the Roumanian delegates were in vain; even
Lord Beaconsfield, in a private audience, contented
himself with the remark that "in politics
ingratitude is often the reward of the greatest
services."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the resolutions of the Congress
left Roumania in a worse plight than before
the war. Even the most advanced Liberals, who
had formerly championed the Jewish cause, were
exasperated at having this measure thrust upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
them by the Foreign Powers as a condition,
before their independence, honourably achieved
with blood and steel upon the field of glory,
could be recognised. Moreover, the compensation
offered, the Delta of the Danube and the Dobrudscha
as far as the line Silistria-Mangalia, so far
from being appreciated, was actually opposed
with vigour by a large section of the nation.</p>

<p>The Prince's position was doubly difficult:
himself the most tolerant of mortals, he viewed
all attempts at persecution with the sternest disfavour;
as a ruler, he could not close his eyes to
the inevitable result of the emancipation of the
Moldavian Jews, who would then have gained
possession of the greater part of the heavily
mortgaged estates in that district. Whatever
happened, it seemed as though the enormous
sacrifices which Roumania had borne had failed
to secure any adequate recompense; whilst, on the
other hand, England had received Cyprus, and
Austria was to administer Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bratianu, therefore, was only too correct
when he reported from Berlin: "Prince Bismarck
alone was straightforward with us from the commencement
when he told us Bessarabia was lost.
He was sincere, for it would have been to his
interest if we had come to an understanding with
Russia direct! All the other Great Powers were
interested in supporting our resistance, for they
were then able, by sacrificing us in the end, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
obtain more concessions for themselves from
Russia."</p>

<p>Prince Charles wrote to his father on August 4,
1878:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The struggles which Roumania has had to
endure during the last few months, and has yet
to endure, are, beyond all comparison, more
serious than those at Plevna and Widin. To
issue victorious from them will be far more
honourable to my country than the laurels
gathered on the battlefields of Bulgaria! It is
pitiful that Europe should force a young and
energetic State, which has shown its power and
vitality in a bloody war, to cede a province. The
Berlin Congress might return to Russia what the
Treaty of Paris took away, but it wounds us
deeply that our independence, achieved on the
battlefield, should be made contingent upon the
cession of Bessarabia, and much patience and
moderation are necessary to allow such a course to
be adopted. We shall, however, show the Powers
that we know how to extricate ourselves with
honour from the worst situations.</p>

<p>"As soon as the Articles referring to Roumania
became known, the greatest consternation
arose, and even the most peaceful of the people
declared they would rather not acquire independence
at such a price. I convened a Council of
Ministers and conferred with a few political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
leaders, advising the greatest care, since a hasty
step might bring the country into extreme
danger. Europe has need of peace and insists on
it; it will not, therefore, be content with half
measures, but will execute the resolutions of the
Congress by force. After their first anger had
been subdued, people here became more reasonable,
and recognised that it was impossible to
resist the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>"We closed the Chambers, and decided to allow
the Russian occupation of Bessarabia to approach.
We shall then avoid any record in writing, withdraw
our officials, and admit a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>.
When this painful affair has once come to an end,
we must find a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</i> with Russia, in
order to be able to regulate a multitude of
details without hindrance. All this will, however,
be effected by the Administration; Crown
and Chamber are not to take any part therein.</p>

<p>"The territory on the right bank of the Danube
is not given to us in exchange for Bessarabia; we
take it simply as a war indemnity, and because
Europe gives it to us. We have thus gained very
much both morally and materially, and no one
can refuse us their respect. The districts promised
us by the Congress have a great future,
and in a few years I hope to raise them to a
flourishing condition. Their inhabitants think
themselves fortunate in being connected with
Roumania, and have already sent me many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
addresses, to which, up to the present, I have not
replied.</p>

<p>"Küstendje is a beautiful port, and, like the
railway to Tschernavoda, was constructed by an
English company. A few good hotels and installations
have been made there for sea bathing.
The situation is healthy."</p></blockquote>

<p>About this period the Prince received the following
letter from Prince Charles Anthony of
Hohenzollern:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The whole strength of the nation must now
be concentrated on the acquisition of the Dobrudscha
and the economic and political tasks
which have arisen there.... A reconciliation
with Russia may perhaps prove the most urgent
duty of self-preservation."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the anniversary of Grivitza Prince Charles
addressed a cordial telegram to the Czar, receiving
in turn a very hearty reply.</p>

<p>After the army had been placed on a peace
footing, and the Russian troops had quitted the
country, Prince Charles devoted himself to the
task of carrying out the conditions imposed by
the Berlin Congress. Since Article VII. of the
Roumanian Constitution stipulates that only
Christians can become citizens, a <em>Constituante</em>
had to be convened at Bucharest, in the hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
that the alteration of the Constitution would
secure the necessary two-thirds majority.</p>

<p>The Ministry decided about this time to request
Prince Charles to assume the title of Royal Highness,
as being more suitable to the ruler of a
country which surpassed many a European kingdom
in point of area and population. The Powers
immediately recognised the new title, whilst
Prince Charles Anthony was of opinion that it
would have been better to follow the example
of Belgium, and assume the royal dignity forthwith.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September the Chambers
assembled to recognise the Treaty of Berlin, which,
after many violent speeches, they managed to do
just one day before the cession of Bessarabia, the
resolution being worded as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Chamber of Deputies has taken cognisance
of the dispositions made by the Treaty of
Berlin regarding Roumania. Compelled by the
decision of the Powers, and in order not to be
an obstacle to the consolidation of peace, the
Chamber empowers the Government to comply
with the universal wish of Europe by recalling
the civil and military authorities from Bessarabia,
and taking possession of the Dobrudscha, the
Danube Delta, and the Serpents' Island. The
other questions will be settled by constitutional
methods."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>The Russian occupation of Bessarabia passed off
uneventfully; the Roumanian officials retired
without a word, and Prince Charles was spared
the pain of signing his name to any document in
connection with the cession. A marked contrast
to this was afforded by the Austrian occupation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which encountered
violent resistance, and was accompanied by much
bloodshed.</p>

<p>A couple of days after the withdrawal from
Bessarabia, the triumphal entry of the Roumanian
army into Bucharest took place, and the striking
unanimity with which the dignified bearing of
the Prince and his subjects was recognised both
at home and abroad afforded Prince Charles much
consolation during this critical period.</p>


<h3><i>From the</i> <span class="smcap">German Crown Prince</span>, <i>October 19th, 1878</i>.</h3>

<p>"You know that you were much in my thoughts
during the Congress and afterwards, in the midst
of that truly difficult period of negotiations about
the cession of Bessarabia. But I purposely refrained
from writing to you, because I did not know how I
was to express myself in view of such events.</p>

<p>"I was convinced that you would estimate the
circumstances correctly, and be able to take
matters as they are. The exchange of territory,
however, hit you doubly hard, since only too
many were anxious to throw suspicion on you
for being an <em>immigrant</em> wanting in 'patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
feeling.' Thank Heaven, the representatives of
your country appear to have submitted with the
necessary resignation, so that you have been
relieved of a real trouble. May Roumania now
speedily realise all the advantages which may
still be drawn from the Dobrudscha, though it
offers but little, and may the construction of
bridges, canals, and ports mark a new era in your
rule. If such undertakings succeed, a true substitute
will have been found for all you have given
up, and one day the advantage may perhaps be
on your side. This is my heart's desire.</p>

<p>"Russia's conduct, after the manful service you
did for that colossal Empire, meets with censure
on all sides. I do not understand the importance
which they attach to that piece of land. But
they have scarcely got their way, when Russia
begins to stir up a question about Afghanistan,
which again threatens the peace, though for the
present only in Asia! As if enough blood had
not been shed already. It is to be hoped that
the good Ameer will listen to reason, but the
general tension is nevertheless very great."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Referring to the events of the last summer, the
attempted assassination of the Emperor William
I., and his own Regency, the Crown Prince
remarks:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"My best thanks, though late, for your welcome
and sympathetic letter in June. You felt with
us what a heavy blow had fallen on us all,
and rejoiced with us over the recovery of the dear
Emperor, whom I found wonderfully well at Cassel
and Baden. His freshness and mobility, his
memory and spirits are completely restored. Yet
those who see him daily, say that mental exertion
still tires him easily, and that he is therefore
very willing to avoid it. His resumption of official
duties is thus postponed still further, so that I
shall probably not be free from this burden until
December on his return from Wiesbaden to
Berlin!...</p>

<p>"A few days ago we bade farewell to Henry
for two years. Seldom has a separation fallen so
heavily on my heart as this. He proceeds round
Cape Horn <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viâ</i> Rio, and will then join his station
in Japan.</p>

<p>"William has just returned from England and
Scotland; he met Charlotte and Bernard in Paris,
where they amused themselves immensely in the
strictest incognito....</p>

<p>"My wife and I are tolerably well in spite of
these troublous times, which in less than half a year
have brought me a Peace Congress, marriages,
special legislation, dissolution of the Imperial Diet,
elections, and the execution of a death sentence.
In all these events I see God's will that I should
taste of everything that still is set before me. But
it is not easy to exercise the rights and bear <em>all</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the burdens of a monarch to the best of one's
ability and conscience without taking the sole
responsibility.</p>

<p>"To-morrow the Imperial Diet concludes its
deliberations; let us hope that the law against
social democracy marks the commencement of a
radical cure, by means of which this evil may be
overcome. It will, however, cost us much pains
before we can rid ourselves of this abortion, which
has increased with such incredible rapidity since
the teaching of this unhealthy society finds a
ready market, and the attempted assassinations,
which will now multiply still more, show the direction
taken by a misunderstood application...."</p></blockquote>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Alexander of Battenberg</span>, <i>October 20th, '78</i>.</h3>

<p>"You can imagine how I have followed the
march of political events. The consequence of
the unhappy Peace of Berlin will probably be
that we, <i>i.e.</i>, the Russians, shall soon have to
draw sword again. Should we then be comrades
in arms once more? Probably not!</p>

<p>"What do you think of Dondukow's doings?
Here in Jugenheim I am too far away to be able to
form an opinion, and the papers contain nothing
but lies; the events in Bulgaria interest me
greatly, as <em>secret inquiries continue to reach me
from time to time</em>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first ambassador to the Roumanian Court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
Count Hoyos, was sent by Austria, an example
soon followed by Turkey, and later on by Russia,
who raised the rank of its representative first
from Consul-General to Resident Minister, and
then to Ambassador. In return, the Diplomatic
Agents of Roumania in Vienna, St. Petersburg,
and Constantinople were created Ambassadors.
A very friendly understanding with Turkey was
now initiated, and proved to be of great advantage
to Roumania during the transactions of the Frontier
Commission, which was presided over by the
former State. In strict accordance with the provisions
of the Treaty of Berlin, the frontier line
was fixed close to the gates of Silistria, in spite of
the immediate protests of the Russian Commissary,
who succeeded in delaying a final settlement
for a period of years.</p>

<p>On November 26, 1878, the Roumanians proceeded
to take possession of the Dobrudscha, and
were received with the greatest enthusiasm, to the
surprise of the Austrian Emperor, whose experience
in Bosnia had led him to advise Prince
Charles not to garrison the Dobrudscha with less
than a Division.</p>

<p>The first anniversary of Plevna was marked by
the issue of a stirring Army Order by Prince
Charles, who also exchanged warm congratulations
by telegraph with the Czar and the Archduke
Nicholas.</p>

<p>Rumours in the Press pointed to the probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
selection of Prince Alexander of Battenberg for
the newly created throne of Bulgaria, whilst the
selection of Prince Charles also received public
support. In reply to his Ministers, who considered
that his candidature was desirable, Prince
Charles remarked that the moment for such a
step had passed. Not <em>against</em>, but only <em>with</em> the
aid of Russia could such a candidature succeed!</p>

<p>Although the Chamber and Senate at first
supported the speedy convocation of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Constituante</i>,
months elapsed before the three readings
took place in the Chamber before proceeding to a
dissolution to allow the elections to take place.</p>

<p>The third reading did not take place till April 5,
1879, after Prince Bismarck had in a somewhat
threatening manner requested to be informed
when the Jewish question was to be settled.
This question was transmitted through Austria-Hungary,
the Roumanian representative in Berlin
being passed over!</p>

<p>In addition to this pressing question of the
Jewish franchise, the old trouble about the re-purchase
of the Strousberg Railway Line was
raised by Germany, which roundly declared that
her attitude in future depended on this measure
being carried out.</p>

<p>The Prince of Roumania wrote to Prince Charles
Anthony:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"Although we wish to acquire the railway
lines, we nevertheless feel hurt at this pressure.
The Jewish question, and the purchase of the
railways are two such important problems that
they can hardly be grappled with simultaneously.
Bleichröder's influence is evident in both affairs.</p>

<p>"Our relations with Russia are no better,
though Schuwaloff said to my Ambassador: 'I
admit that we have committed many blunders
with regard to you, but remember that you have
done the same with us. We have no reason to
quarrel; on the contrary, at such a time we ought
to be on the best footing.'</p>

<p>"We have little hope that the question of the
Dobrudscha frontier will be decided to our advantage,
since Germany is quite on the side of
Russia. Bismarck is the man who deters those
Powers which are not yet in diplomatic connection
with us. The proposal to recognise Servia proceeded
from Berlin to the other Powers, with the
remark that a distinction must be made between
one country that fulfils its obligations and another
that seeks to avoid them!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Prince Charles Anthony had already written as
follows to his son in February 1879:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In spite of the completed cession of Bessarabia,
Russia still appears to be hostile to you, and the
remainder of Europe, including the German Empire,
does not take up a resolute attitude against that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Power. Every step taken by Roumania, conscious
of her achieved independence, is hindered and
opposed! It would be desirable to put an end to
your ominous Jewish question, if only to remove
every pretext from the Powers."</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, a few months later:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is nothing left for you but to carry
through the Jewish question a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout prix</i>, in spite
of all the antipathies of the populace, and regardless
of the mischievous nature of the whole
measure."</p></blockquote>

<p>The whole country, Moldavia in particular, was
in a state of the greatest excitement, and on no
occasion were the elections so largely participated
in as those which preceded this Revising Chamber.
Prince Charles, accompanied by the Crown Prince
of Sweden, made a tour through Moldavia before
the elections took place. The National festival,
the 10th-22nd May, was celebrated with particularity
and fervour in 1879. The Roumanian army
presented a sword of honour to their sovereign,
inscribed with the names of the victorious actions
and the following dedication: "To the victorious
leader in the War of 1877-78, from his grateful
Army," and "Virtus Romana rediviva."</p>

<p>The opening of the Revising Chamber was but
the prelude to a summer of violent political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
struggles, which kept the national feelings at a
dangerously high pitch of excitement. The
Ministry would not lay definite proposals before
the Chambers, but seemed anxious to allow the
nation to take the lead in this vital question,
whilst a strong current of public feeling advocated
opposition to the demands of the Berlin Treaty.</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>.</h3>

<p>"In the event of an unsatisfactory solution,
they are determined in Berlin to intervene by
means of a Collective Note which will dictate to
us what rights we are to concede to the Jews.
Such a step would, of course, arouse national excitement,
and only further increase resistance; but
this might become a great danger to the country
apart from the humiliation which it includes.
The question is whether execution would follow
intervention, and what shape the execution
would take? Italy contents itself with the removal
of Article VII. of the Constitution, and likewise
England, with the naturalisation of a few Jews.
Waddington, however, demands a radical solution,
and Berlin insists on the re-purchase of the railways
under the conditions imposed by her bankers.
The German Chancellor is opposed to us, and all
the goodwill of the Emperor is of no avail."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Prince Bismarck informed the Roumanian Government
through Count Andrassy that he placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
no confidence in their good faith, and that, in his
opinion, Roumania was still a dependent State.
In the event of her resisting the resolutions of
the Berlin Congress he intended to treat with the
Suzerain at Constantinople! Count Andrassy
in vain represented the difficulty of the Roumanian
situation, for Prince Bismarck was armed
with the argument that he considered the
honour of the German Empire pledged in this
matter, whilst England proposed a Collective Note
to be executed by the Austrian Cabinet. Yet,
despite the threatening aspect of affairs, the Roumanian
Chambers became more and more obstinate,
and refused to hasten a solution of the constitutional
questions involved.</p>

<p>The marriage of the Prince's youngest brother,
Frederick, with Princess Louise of Thurn and
Paris, took place at Regensburg in June 1879, and
the German Emperor and Empress celebrated their
golden wedding at Berlin. The same month, however,
brought the terrible news of the death of
the unfortunate Prince Imperial, who had volunteered
for service with the British troops acting
against the Zulus. In reply to Prince Charles'
letter of sympathy the Empress Eugenie wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Chislehurst</span>, <i>August 19th, 1879</i>.
</p>

<p>"You recall to me the days of happiness, and
by recurring to the present you share my illimitable
grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>"Everything has fallen from me, and only two
tombs are left of all I loved. I rest near them,
and here my isolation seems less great. I have
known both extremes and the want of stability of
human fortunes. We are wrong in not always
fixing our eyes beyond this life on that one where
nothing changes, and where we shall rejoin those
whom we love to all eternity.</p>

<p>"I beg that you will thank the Princess for the
sympathy which my recent and overwhelming
misfortune has elicited from in her.</p>

<p class="sig">
"EUGENIE."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The death of the German Crown Prince's third
son, Waldemar, at the early age of eleven, gave
occasion to the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Potsdam</span>, <i>July 27th, 1879</i>.
</p>

<p>"Your kind and sympathetic letter, no less than
Elisabeth's deeply touching verses, were very
welcome to my poor wife and myself. You both
feel with and for us, for God decreed a like trouble
for you, and even though your fate was much
harder, still we all have to bear the heavy destiny
of surviving our children.</p>

<p>"We endeavour to bear God's decree with
resignation, but we cannot even now become reconciled
to the loss of another son from the happy
circle of our family, a son, too, who justified our
highest hopes, and already displayed character at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
an early age. It is so difficult to accustom ourselves
to everyday life without our most dearly
loved child, for every step reminds us that he will
never appear again, and that we must learn to live
without our companion.</p>

<p>"... Our life, which, moreover, has never been
a tranquil one, had already become gloomy by the
moving incidents of last year; with this sorrow it
has lost what remaining joy it still had to offer us,
and we can only gather satisfaction from the execution
of our tasks and duties.</p>

<p>"You very rightly lay stress upon the fact that
such grief causes us more than ever to sympathise
with others in their sorrow and to seek their
society. Many other things are first apparent to
us in our time of mourning, and it is certainly
through the medium of this chastening that we
are to be prepared for a higher calling, which
appears dark and mysterious to dwellers on earth.
It is not for us to inquire 'Why?' and yet we do
so; we are but human beings, to whom the work
of Divine justice is hidden here, but will be made
clear to us <em>there</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>The chivalrous Prince Alexander of Battenberg,
who had been elected Prince of Bulgaria, experienced
the greatest difficulties in taking over the
reins of government, as the following letter shows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"I am now passing through the same stage as
you did last year: devoted with my whole heart
to the Czar Alexander, I am anxious to do
nothing that can be called anti-Russian. Unfortunately
the Russian officials have acted with
the utmost want of tact; confusion prevails in
every office, and peculation, thanks to Dondukow's
decrees, is all but sanctioned. I am daily confronted
with the painful alternative of having to
decide either to assent to the Russian demands or
to be accused in Russia of ingratitude and of
'injuring the most sacred feelings of the Bulgarians.'
My situation is truly terrible; I reject
everything opposed to my conscience, and therefore
have to write daily to the Czar in order to
obtain a hearing before the calumnies of the
Russian officials shall have had time to reach him.
I will tell you everything shortly on the occasion
of my visit."</p></blockquote>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Alexander Prince of Bulgaria</span>, <i>August 22nd, 1879</i>.</h3>

<p>"A thousand thanks for your long and kind
letter, the conferring of your Grand Cross, and the
geniality with which you welcomed my Envoy.
I have, it is true, never doubted your friendship,
but to see it once more confirmed in this handsome
fashion has nevertheless made me very
happy. I shall reply to Elisabeth's kind letter
direct.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I cannot pay you a visit before
October, for I have so much to do that I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
quit the country. All my Ministers are a little
anxious, and I myself have more or less to decide
everything.</p>

<p>"The solitude here is very great, but as at
present I am busy from morning to night I feel it
the less. The idea of marriage is antipathetic
to me: I feel that I have no right to bring a wife
to this lonely spot; moreover, I do not want to
bind myself, in order that, in the event of affairs
turning out badly, my convictions may not be
influenced by any external consideration. Everything
will depend upon the first National Assembly.
It is not easy to be Dondukow's heir.</p>

<p>"With my whole heart I sympathise with you
regarding the Jewish question. What a fatal
thing it is for us all that the Great Powers have
declared themselves Masters of the World!</p>

<p>"Although hostile to the Treaty of Berlin, I
have nevertheless given it my complete adherence
in my new position. I have conceived my mission
from the European standpoint as far as possible,
and allow the same law to apply to all. Consequently
I sought to help the Mohammedans as
much as possible, but utilised the moment to
introduce universal service; if the Mohammedans
want to enjoy the advantages of all subjects, they
must also bear the disadvantages. I am in everything
the opposite of my predecessors; I shall
make fewer speeches, but work more, and the
final result will, it is to be hoped, justify me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>"If only the frontiers at least were settled!
So long as this is not the case there will be no
peace in the country. (I do not thereby mean
Arab-Tabia, but the South and West, where disturbances
always take place.) Everything beyond
this must be delivered verbally.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the course of the summer the unhappy
Jewish question became "in truth a gigantic
struggle," as Prince Charles informed his father:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whilst the country considers me the defender
of the rights of the Jews, the Foreign Powers
complain that I do not champion them with sufficient
energy. This reproach, however, affects me
very little. There is only one path which can
lead me to my goal, and that is laid down by the
Constitution."</p></blockquote>

<p>Owing to this struggle a modification of the
Ministry became necessary towards the end of
July, and M. Sturdza was sent to Berlin to lay
the difficulties of the situation before Prince
Bismarck, whilst Prince Charles Anthony turned
to the aged Emperor William.</p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>July 24th, 1879</i>.</h3>

<p>"Only a few words to-day to tell you that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
saw the Emperor (William) in the Mainau the
day before yesterday. He asked me to come to
his room after dinner, when I at last found an
opportunity of discussing Roumanian affairs and
of commending you to his care. I can now tell
you that I was greatly surprised and pleased
with the Emperor's opinions, even though I must
regretfully limit this favourable impression by the
fact that the Emperor has certainly not been
kept <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au courant</i> with the situation. He at first
ascribed the whole blame to England, who is
urging the Jewish question with the greatest
want of consideration, and from whose policy
Germany cannot dissociate herself.</p>

<p>"When I proved that the exact opposite was
the case, and compared the constantly progressive
moderation of England with the harsh attitude
of Germany, which never has regard to circumstances,
the Emperor was highly astonished; he
would not believe it at all, and said that the
Jewish question was entirely antipathetic to
him; that he was acquainted with similar circumstances
in Poland and Russia; and that, if he
had not been suffering from his wounds during
the Berlin Congress, he would never have consented
to the present extension of this question.
In brief, I am convinced that the Imperial
Chancellor did not consult the Emperor in this
matter at all, or at least did not report it to him
fully."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days later Prince Charles Anthony forwarded
to his son a copy of a letter to the
Empress, written by the Emperor at Gastein,
July 25, 1879:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With regard to Roumania I have, as you
know, from the outset most strongly disapproved
of the resolution of the Congress concerning the
Jewish question, though only after the blow had
fallen, since I was not at the head of affairs.</p>

<p>"Since then I have, of course, only had to
support the strict execution of the resolutions of
the Congress, but I have demanded at every
opportunity that no pressure be used in this
matter, for I know by experience what the Jews
are in those regions&mdash;starting with Posen, Poland,
Lithuania, and Volhynia&mdash;and the Roumanian
Jews are said to be even worse! The whole
Jewish question there has been championed so
violently by England. Lord Odo Russell confessed
as much to me in answer to my representations,
indicating at the same time by a gesture
his disagreement with them.</p>

<p>"I explained the attitude which I have adopted
with regard to the Jewish question (on which
the recognition of my cousin as an independent
Sovereign depends) to the Prince of Hohenzollern,
when he excitedly complained of the extreme
severity of our note. I added, however, that I
was not acquainted with the note in question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
On my making inquiry, the latest document for
Bucharest was only yesterday laid before me. It
states that the Powers would be satisfied by the
annulment of the restrictive article of the
Roumanian Constitution being recognised as a
principle, leaving the decision as to the method
of carrying it into effect to a later date, when the
Ministry and Chamber have come to an agreement.
When once this method has been accepted,
nothing will impede the recognition of the Prince.
I commission you to communicate this most
exactly in Krauchenwies, and also add that I
think that Charles of Roumania and his Ministry,
which has just been changed, should accept this
method; the Chambers will then have to practise
self-restraint.</p>

<p>"You will remember that I always took the
part of the Roumanian Government, whenever
difficulties arose between Christians and Jews,
whilst England invariably took the opposite side,
because she sees a refined Rothschild in <em>every</em>
Jew."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whilst the German Emperor thus roundly
declared his interest in the Roumanian Sovereign,
his Chancellor proved no less sympathetic towards
M. Sturdza, at an interview which took place
at Kissingen. Prince Bismarck admitted that
the Berlin Congress had set Roumania a hard
task, but remarked that the resolutions must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
executed in their entirety. Germany was only
demanding what France and Italy also wished in
the matter of the Jews, of whom there were a
large number crowded together in certain portions
of the country. The Roumanians must open the
war upon economic ground: work and save, found
banks, &amp;c. The Empire was anxious to maintain
friendly relations with Roumania, although the
latter had until recently treated Germany somewhat
cavalierly. The sympathy of the Roumanian
nation with France, though perhaps only natural,
had in the end annoyed Germany, and it was
never wise to annoy anybody, least of all one who
happened to be powerful. In order to ameliorate
the existing relations, it was necessary that the
railway question should disappear.</p>

<p>"One must be acquainted with the commencement
of this affair in order to realise its importance.
No one can be blamed for it, neither we
nor Roumania: the affair exists, and we must get
rid of it with profit to both parties.</p>

<p>"Our interest is considerable, since about one
hundred million marks are invested there. These
moneys must be rescued from a precarious situation,
in which it has often been the duty of the
State to defend them, and on each occasion this
has strained the relations between the two States.</p>

<p>"This railway affair commenced with Dr. Strousberg,
who dragged the Silesian magnates into it,
and with them all their friends and dependents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
were in turn involved. To-day we find amongst
the bondholders of the Roumanian Railway Company,
lords and ladies, lackeys of the great
houses, and even cabdrivers&mdash;in a word, almost
the whole of Berlin. Indeed, more than that, the
King himself had to intervene to save a few of
the Silesian magnates, when Strousberg could
carry on no longer! He then applied to Bleichröder,
who was, however, rich enough not to need
to address himself to so involved a question.
Nevertheless, he did so because he was asked,
and also on account of the credit which it brought
him. He has taken the matter in hand, and we
are bound to support him. But the King has
done even more than this. He has had to assist
the great Silesian nobles out of his privy purse.
It is, therefore, easy to understand that every
one is anxious to escape from this painful situation.
You must, therefore, solve these two
questions in order to enter the ranks of the
Independent States. An independent Roumania
will throw a heavy weight into the balance of
Oriental questions.... Roumania has an area
of 2500 square miles (German) and 6,000,000
inhabitants. It might have 10,000,000; and how
powerful it would be then."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Jews were admitted to the franchise on
October 18, 1879, by an alteration of Article VII.
of the Constitution, and over 900 Jews who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
served with the colours in 1877-78 were immediately
admitted to the rights of citizenship.
Though the situation at one period became so
critical that the German Empress sent a "quite
confidential" warning that delay was fraught with
danger, the demands of Germany in the matter of
the railway purchase were satisfied three months
later, and the independence of the Roumanian State
was in consequence fully recognised by all the
European Powers.</p>


<h3><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Charles Anthony</span>, <i>February 11th, 1880</i>.</h3>

<p>"Sandro<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> is in despair about the doings of the
Panslavists, who are making his task uncommonly
difficult; had he only Bulgarians to deal with, he
would get on easily enough.... He is determined
to speak openly to the Czar Alexander about the
Panslavonic and Nihilist agitation in Sofia. He
returns to his capital at the end of March, when
the newly elected National Assembly will be
opened; it is not much better than the former.
So long as the Czar Alexander lives he will personally
exert a favourable influence in Bulgaria,
but when he dies everything will be changed. I
told Sandro, who has much confidence in me, that
if he possesses enough strength to live down this
period of suffering, he will be richly rewarded for
his patience and endurance. But few, perhaps,
have the patience that I had, and still have."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>
<p>During the stay of the Prince of Bulgaria in
St. Petersburg an attempt was made by Nihilists
to blow up the Winter Palace, but it failed owing
to a mere chance. Prince Alexander of Hesse,
the father of the Prince of Bulgaria, reached St.
Petersburg later than was expected, and so caused
the dinner to be postponed to a later hour. The
explosion, which destroyed the dining-room, took
place, therefore, whilst their Majesties were in an
antechamber.</p>

<p>The English elections in March displaced the
Conservative Ministry and summoned Gladstone
to the head of the Government. About the same
time Prince Charles despatched the President of
the Ministry to Berlin, to hand the insignia of the
Star of Roumania to the Emperor William, the
Crown Prince, and Prince Bismarck. The last-named
suggested that Roumania had claims to
become a kingdom, but the opinion in Vienna was
in favour of delaying this step.</p>


<h3><i>From the</i> <span class="smcap">German Crown Prince</span>.</h3>

<p>"Your relations towards Russia will grow exceptionally
difficult; for, no matter how great the
confidence one may place in the magnanimity of
the Czar, the less can one trust his Government,
looking impartially at the actions of their agents,
who are actively propagating the views of the
Panslavists in all directions, and are finally making
it seem impossible for the Government to disavow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
and abandon their countrymen who have gone to
such lengths. One would really think that Russia
was large enough already, and that she had enough
to do at home, and might leave her neighbours in
peace. Bulgaria seems to me like a Russian
province, which is only waiting for a hint to allow
itself to be incorporated; and Battenberg, even
though he possessed ever so much foresight and
determination, will hardly be able to steer against
the Russian stream.</p>

<p>"Our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapprochement</i> and understanding with
Austria last autumn was, no doubt, under the
circumstances, a correct step, and has given the
Czar's Empire something to think about. If we
could only succeed in preventing France from
forming the ardently desired alliance with Russia&mdash;which
has probably been postponed for some
time&mdash;we might then see favourable guarantees
for peace everywhere. No one wants war, because
all have much to do at home, and have enough to
think over in the consequences of the last bloody
war. Above all things, we Germans do not wish
for war, since we gained far more by the last than
we ever dared to hope for, and we anticipate no
advantage from any extension.</p>

<p>"Permit me to inform you and dear Elisabeth
that the premature hints of the Press regarding
the betrothal of my eldest son, William, to Victoria
of Schleswig-Holstein, eldest daughter of the late
Fritz of Schleswig-Holstein-Augustenburg, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
quite true. Mutual and deep-seated inclination
has brought the two together, and this fulfils the
sincere wish of my wife and myself to greet as our
daughter-in-law a Princess so distinguished by
gifts of spirit, heart, and temperament, as well as
by dignified grace. God grant that this union of
hearts may one day be a blessing to the Empire."</p>

<p class="noind">
"<span class="smcap">My dear Cousin</span>,
</p>

<p>"At last we have arrived at the goal of
our long-cherished wishes. It has cost many
a hard and bitter struggle before we could see
you standing independent before the world!
May the proverb come true which says, 'Slow
but sure.'</p>

<p>"I have never concealed the sympathy which I
have always cherished for you alike personally
and as a Hohenzollern; but when many are striving
to the same goal and each goes his own way,
time and sacrifices are required until they are at
length all gathered together! So I too have had
to temporise in order to recognise you at last
before the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Bismarck</span>, <i>May 20th, 1880</i>.</h3>

<p>"I share your Royal Highness's regret that
the acquisitions resulting from the peace, apart
from the dissolution of the relations to the Porte,
were not in proportion with the achievements and
valour of your Royal Highness's army; but, having
regard to the dignity and weight of the Powers
by which Roumania is surrounded, and also to
the difficulty of securing a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</i> amongst
them, which would give us peace for the time
being, I do not know of any possible means by
which greater advantages could have been obtained
for Roumania.</p>

<p>"The difficulty of the historical situation is
that on the far bank of the Danube there are no
national <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">points d'appui</i> to strengthen Roumania,
and, on the other side, the population belongs to
the two great neighbouring Empires. To live
in peace with these is necessary for the consolidation
of affairs, and to select at least one of them
as a certain ally will always be the object of
Roumanian policy. In this historical situation
the acquisition of the Dobrudscha was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pis-aller</i>,
whose favourable aspect&mdash;the possession of the
sea-coast&mdash;will increase in value during the
further development of your resources."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In reply to his father, who urged him to fulfil
his promise to return home after an absence of six
years, Prince Charles wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The still incomplete negotiations about the
Arab-Tabia question will unfortunately cause a
slight delay in our departure for abroad. The
reason why the Powers delay so long in completing
a matter which has reached its last stage is
unintelligible. In order partly to give way to
Russia, they intend to grant Bulgaria a territorial
compensation. An exchange of notes has arisen
on this point, and we have directed our Ambassadors
to express the expectation that the
frontier defined by the International Commission
will be adhered to. However, in the end it will
be Roumania <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui payera les pots cassés</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, they
will give us with one hand what they take away
with the other!"</p></blockquote>

<p>On July 29, 1880, the frontier was definitely
fixed and sanctioned by the Powers, and though
Roumania did not acquire all she had fought for,
she nevertheless retained Arab-Tabia.</p>

<p>At length, on August 10, the Prince and his
consort quitted Roumania to enjoy a well-earned
rest in Germany. On passing through Ischl, Prince
Charles was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the 6th
Infantry Regiment by the Emperor of Austria.
The Prince then rejoined his dearly loved parents
at the Weinburg, and Princess Elisabeth proceeded
to visit her mother. Visits were then paid to the
Courts of Dresden and Berlin, where the Roumanian
sovereigns received a hearty welcome. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
German Emperor also appointed the Prince to the
Colonelcy of one of his regiments&mdash;the 1st Hanoverian
Dragoons (No. 9).</p>

<p>The beautiful autumn months at the Weinburg
passed only too quickly, for the cares of State
demanded the return of the Prince about the
middle of October. After attending the Roumanian
manœuvres near Bucharest and Jassy, Prince
Charles paid a visit to Rustchuk, where he was
greeted with the greatest enthusiasm as the
liberator of Bulgaria.</p>

<p>The important question of the succession to
the Roumanian throne had been fully discussed
during Prince Charles's visit to Germany, with
the result that the constitutional right of succession
of the Prince's brothers and their heirs was
officially recognised by the princely House of
Hohenzollern. This was effected by the exchange
of letters, which were laid before the Chambers
as soon as they assembled. A hearty vote
of thanks rewarded the royal couple for their
disinterested solicitude for the welfare of the
State.</p>

<p>The anniversary of Plevna was marked by a
pleasant incident&mdash;the presentation of a piece of
statuary to Princess Elisabeth by the wives of
the officers of the Roumanian army. The Princess
herself was represented nursing a wounded
soldier as an emblem of her noble activity during
the terrible period of the war of 1877-78.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in 1881 the Roumanian Ambassador in
Berlin reported that the representatives of the
Powers had all expressed their opinion that the
time had come for Roumania to be created a kingdom.
The Ministry wished to delay this solemn
act till the day of the National Festival, May 22,
but the ceremony was precipitated by an unforeseen
event. On March 13, Czar Alexander fell a
victim to a Nihilist plot, and the Roumanian
Opposition seized the occasion to accuse the
Liberals of aiming at Republican and Anti-dynastic
ideals. To refute this calumny effectually,
the Liberal Ministry proposed the elevation
of the Roumanian Principality into the
"Kingdom of Roumania," amidst the enthusiastic
plaudits of Chamber and Senate. After the
motion had been unanimously carried, the legislative
bodies proceeded to the Palace, where
Prince Charles attached his signature to the
document in their presence with the following
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is a grand and solemn moment, in which
the representatives of the nation approach me
with a unanimous resolution of the legislative
bodies. Herewith begins a new page in the
volume of Roumanian national life; here, too,
ends a period full of struggle and difficulties, but
full also of virile effort and heroic deeds. At this
moment I repeat what I have so often said before:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the wish of the nation is the guide and goal of
my life. I have ruled this land for fifteen years;
I have been surrounded by the love and confidence
of the nation; this love and confidence
have made the good days even brighter, and
have strengthened and confirmed me during those
which were evil. I was therefore proud to be
Prince, and that title has been dear to me, round
which the past has entwined glory and strength.</p>

<p>"But Roumania thinks that it would be more in
keeping with her position to proclaim herself a
kingdom. I therefore accept the kingly title,
not for myself personally, but for the aggrandisement
of my country, and to fulfil the long-cherished
wish of every Roumanian. This title
will not in any way alter the close bond which
unites me to the nation by all that we have
fought for and experienced together.</p>

<p>"May the first King of Roumania enjoy the same
love that has supported the last Prince through
all his troubles! The affection of this noble and
brave nation, to whom I have devoted my whole
existence, is more to me than all the greatness
and brilliancy of a crown."</p></blockquote>

<p>This sudden and unexpected fulfilment of a
long-cherished hope aroused the greatest enthusiasm
in every class of Roumanian society. The
recognition of the new kingdom by the Great
Powers followed very shortly, the reception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the news by the Emperor William being especially
cordial. Prince Charles Anthony wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The unanimity with which the kingly crown
has been offered you is the surest foundation of
your new and hard-won stability."</p></blockquote>

<p>The coronation of King Charles took place at
Bucharest on May 10-22, 1881. In accordance
with his wish, the royal crown of Roumania was
fashioned of steel from a Turkish gun captured
at Plevna, as a remembrance to all time of the
achievements on the battlefields of Bulgaria, and
of the fact that the new kingdom was not bound or
hampered by old traditions, but looked forward
to a great future springing from a vigorous
beginning.</p>

<p>The golden crown for the Queen was also
fashioned in Roumania from a simple design, without
jewels or ornaments. These crowns were
consecrated by the Metropolitan in the presence of
their Majesties, the Hereditary Prince of Hohenzollern
and his two sons, Ferdinand and Charles,
and the ceremony was attended by delegates
from every district in the kingdom, as well as by
all corporations and other bodies.</p>

<p>After this the crowns were carried in an unending
coronation procession to the royal palace,
where King Charles took the crown into his hands
with these words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I assume with pride this crown, wrought
from a cannon sprinkled with the blood of our
heroes, and consecrated by the Church; I accept
it as a symbol of the independence and power of
Roumania."</p></blockquote>

<h2>EPILOGUE</h2>


<p>Though the years which followed 1881 have
lacked the laurels of the battlefield and the intensity
of the struggle for independence which
characterised the earlier portion of Roumanian
history under King Charles, they are no less
remarkable for continuous and patient progress
in the development of the resources of the kingdom.
Herein, as in sterner matters, the King
has borne the heat and burden of the day; no
one knew better that independence was but
another milestone on the road to the ideal Roumania;
that the regeneration of a nation that
had passed through such vicissitudes could only
follow the unwearying labour of many years; and
that to this end the force of example&mdash;the art of
leading men, not the knack of driving them&mdash;is
of paramount importance. As sovereign of
an independent State, King Charles felt that
he had at last secured a firm basis from
which the latent force of his country might be
fully developed. That these efforts have not
been fruitless is proved by the increase of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Roumanian Budget, despite the saying, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mensonge
en chiffres</i>; for in twenty-five years, from 1866
to 1891, the revenue increased more than threefold
(from 56,000,000frs. in 1866 to 180,000,000frs.
in 1891). It was indeed fortunate for Roumania
that King Charles was endowed with qualities
which enabled him to appreciate the difficulties
of peaceful development in the same way as he
had met the dangers of war. It seemed to him
now that his work had at last commenced in
earnest; his clear eye detected every shortcoming,
though at the same time the future promised
much to his gifted and industrious people. A
great navigable river and the neighbouring sea
offered elements for a greatly increased commerce,
whilst the inexhaustible treasures of the soil, coal
and iron, fulfilled the necessary industrial conditions.</p>

<p>In Roumanian politics, the Liberals remained in
office till 1888 under Jon Bratianu, and aimed at
a rigid centralisation of the Administration, whilst
endeavouring to draw an increasing circle of the
population into the arena of politics. The Conservatives,
on the other hand, could only see
the danger of extending Parliamentary influence
through so politically immature a nation; but
up to 1891 they were unable to realise their
ideals; indeed, they barely succeeded in obtaining
the permanency of the judges. Between these
two extremes lay the sphere of duty of the constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
monarch, the one stable element amid
the fluctuations of the contending parties. The
unwavering loyalty and devotion of the representatives
of the nation to their Sovereign have been
inspired by the qualities with which nature has
so richly endowed King Charles. Resolution,
energy, a knowledge of human character, readiness
to acknowledge and appreciate true individuality&mdash;a
freshness of mind that the driest of
routine work is powerless to dull, and a magnanimous
indulgence that is able to forgive if not
forget&mdash;these are the traits of character which
never fail to exert their influence over all who
come into contact with the King.</p>

<p>The foreign policy of the kingdom has constantly
had one aim and object in view&mdash;to find
support and aid from the great Teutonic Powers,
though at times it seemed as if the religious
tradition of the nation or the sympathy for the
Latin sister nation were about to force the real
interests of Roumania into the background. As
a German prince, King Charles had recognised
the supremacy of Prussia, and never doubted the
power and force of the Teuton genius. The year
1883 marked a decided advance in the friendly
relations of Roumania with Austria and Germany,
though the former had been estranged by the
dispute about the Danube, and an outburst of
Roumanian Chauvinism on the unveiling of a
monument to the Moldavian Prince Stephen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Great, pointing to Bukowina and Siebenbürgen
as Roumanian provinces. On the whole, King
Charles's policy has been successful, though loyal
friendship has had much to bear from Germany's
want of consideration in dealing with the Jews
and the railways, as well as from Austria-Hungary,
whose harsh measures against the Roumanians
of Siebenbürgen have forced many of the
"brethren from over the hills" to seek shelter in
Roumania.</p>

<p>A visit to Berlin in 1883 to act as godfather
to Prince William's<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> second son afforded King
Charles an opportunity of explaining the position
of Roumania in European questions. The King
also succeeded in convincing the Emperor of
Austria that, though it was impossible to forbid a
nation to cherish political aspirations, yet these
sentiments had never entered into the schemes of
the Roumanian statesmen.</p>

<p>From the geographical situation of the kingdom
it was only natural that the army should continue
to receive the greatest attention from the King,
who has never forgotten its willingness to follow
where he led. King Charles does not content
himself with merely watching the training of his
troops at the annual manœuvres, but keeps constant
touch with every detail that may tend to
promote the efficiency and standard of his army.
Nor have the rival claims of education been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
neglected by either King Charles or his consort,
who are indefatigable in their efforts for the
welfare of the national schools.</p>

<p>The frequent change of Ministers was, however,
prejudicial, since the various measures which they
introduced were not long-lived&mdash;indeed, in some
instances were never put into execution! Nevertheless,
the tendency to foster this valuable aid to
true culture lost none of its force. King Charles
devotes an annual sum to the Academy to assist
in the production of an etymological dictionary in
order to aid the study of the beautiful Roumanian
language.</p>

<p>The last link in the chain which bound the
National Church to the Patriarchate of Constantinople
was broken as long ago as 1882; the holy
oil was consecrated in Roumania, and at last in
1885 the Patriarch of Constantinople recognised
the independence of the Roumanian Church.</p>

<p>As early as 1881, twelve years after the first
railway had been constructed by foreign hands,
Roumanian engineers completed the first section
of the State Railway from Buseu to Marascheschti,
the want of which had made itself felt so bitterly
in 1877. Even in the earliest days of his reign
King Charles discussed with Ali Pacha the construction
of a bridge over the Danube.</p>

<p>At that date negotiations were entered into for
a bridge between Giurgiu and Rustchuk, whilst
after the Treaty of Berlin it was proposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
connect the two banks of the Danube below
Silistria. Though this project was discussed by
the Chambers in 1883, it was not till the autumn
of 1890 that matters had progressed sufficiently
to allow King Charles to lay the foundation-stone
of the railway bridge at Feteschti, which
was to unite the Dobrudscha to the mother
country, and complete the iron chain between the
North and Black Seas.</p>

<p>King Charles has been a zealous builder; and,
thanks to him, Roumania can boast of many a
notable pile in Bucharest, Jassy, Crajowa, and
elsewhere. Most noteworthy of all is the Royal
Castle of Pelesch in the peaceful valley of Prahova.
Built in the style of German Renaissance, it reveals
the artistic ideal of its royal builder so far as
stone and mortar can mirror the individuality of
a man. Unlike so many castles, it is perfectly
homogeneous; in a word, Castle Pelesch is the
product of King Charles's artistic taste and indomitable
will.</p>

<p>The death of Prince Charles Anthony on June 2,
1885, was a bitter blow to the King, who lost in
him not only a devoted parent and friend, but a
counsellor whose sage advice had sustained and
strengthened him in many a dark hour. The
passing away of the first German Emperor, followed
too soon by that of his successor, Frederick
III., was a great sorrow to King Charles, who
was deeply attached to the devoted friends of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
early youth, whose loyal friendship had never
wavered for an instant.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, a great solace to the royal
pair to welcome Prince Ferdinand, the second
son of the King's eldest brother, to Roumania as
heir-apparent in 1889. Prince Ferdinand had
already entered the Roumanian army as a subaltern
in 1886.</p>

<p>The history of the other States of the Balkan
Peninsula during these years is by no means so
happy as that of Roumania. Prince Alexander of
Bulgaria was forced by shameful intrigues to quit
his adopted country within a year of a successful
campaign with Servia, whose ruler also abdicated
in favour of his son after endless and painful
quarrels.</p>

<p>The present German Emperor has ably summed
up the great work to which the scion of the Hohenzollern
House has devoted his life, in a letter to
King Charles, in May 1891.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Five and twenty years have elapsed since
your Majesty was first summoned to undertake
the government of the Roumanian State, and a
decade will have passed on the 22nd of this month
since that memorable day on which your Majesty
was able, after a regency victorious in war and
proved in peace, to receive a royal crown for
Roumania and your illustrious house from God's
altar by the unanimous desire of the Roumanian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
nation. Thanks to your Majesty's wise and
vigorous rule over a richly endowed and sober
nation, Roumania has become an equal and respected
member of the Council of the Nations, and
under your Majesty's sceptre every Roumanian
can rejoice in the proud consciousness of belonging
to a State which, as warden of an old-world
civilisation, enjoys the sympathetic goodwill of
all civilised nations.</p>

<p>"Since our Houses are so closely connected, it
is my heart's desire to express my warm congratulations
to your Majesty on this joyful occasion,
and also the hope that, as the bonds of our
personal friendship, so also the firm political
relations of Roumania to the German Empire, may
be preserved in time to come such as they have
been for past years under the enlightened government
of your Majesty.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty will place me under an obligation
by laying my sincere congratulations before her
Majesty the Queen, who has earned undying
honour by your side in cultivating Art and the
Ideal as well as in the formation of the Roumanian
nation."</p></blockquote>
